    "### Ethics\n",
    "Acting ethically involves more than simply complying with the law. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethics can be defined as the set of `moral principles` and `rules of conduct` that people and societies use as a guide for their actions.** Ethical principles may refer to beliefs regarding behavior that an individual expects of himself or herself, as well as shared beliefs regarding standards of behavior expected or required by a community or societal group.\n",
    "- Moral principles are our beliefs about what is right and what is wrong. Widely accepted moral principles include honesty, transparency, fairness or justice, diligence, and respect for the rights of others. \n",
    "- Ethical conduct is behavior that follows moral principles and balances self-interest with both the direct and the indirect consequences of the behavior on others. \n",
    "\n",
    "Laws and regulations\n",
    "- best interest of clients\n",
    "- suitability requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "A `code of ethics` is a formal written set of moral principles that organizations use to communicate their broad (general) expectations for members' behavior. A code of ethics may be `rules-based` or `principles-based`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Principles-based regulation uses the broad set of principles of conduct set out by the financial services regulator. ... This differs from rules-based regulation which leaves less to the regulated parties to decide, and requires the regulator to set out a more specific rule book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some communities will also expand on their codes of ethics and adopt explicit rules or standards that identify specific behaviors required of community members. These `standards of conduct` serve as **benchmarks** for the **minimally acceptable behavior** of community members and can help clarify the code of ethics. \n",
    "\n",
    "    A code of ethics does not necessarily include standards of conduct."

    "### Ethics and Professionalism\n",
    "A profession is defined as an occupational community that has:\n",
    "- Specific education\n",
    "- Expert knowledge\n",
    "- An ethical framework of practice that underpins community trust and recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "Professions distinguish from craft guides and trade bodies. \n",
    "#### How Professions Establish Trust\n",
    "Professions seek to gain trust and recognition. Those that are most credible share the following 10 characteristics.\n",
    "1. **Professions normalize practitioner behavior** Professional bodies develop and enforce ethical standards for their members to uphold. This ethical framework is often complementary to legal requirements and supported by governments and regulators.\n",
    "2. **Professions provide a service to society** Professionals enjoy more commercial success if they see their mission as providing a service that benefits society rather than focusing on their narrow self-interest. Professional organizations are more likely to be granted autonomy if their members and mission are widely accepted in society.\n",
    "3. **Professions are client-focused** A profession's ethical standards should be designed to ensure that professionals place the interests of their clients above their own.\n",
    "4. **Professions have high entry standards** Professionals should be required to demonstrate command of a body of specialist knowledge that goes beyond academic credentials. Membership in a professional body should give employers and clients confidence that high standards have been met with respect to technical skills, knowledge, and ethics.\n",
    "5. **Professions possess a body of expert knowledge** Members should have access to a body of specialist knowledge that they can draw upon to better serve society.\n",
    "6. **Professions encourage and facilitate continuing education** After being admitted to a professional body, members should be required to maintain their competency by completing a minimum amount of continuing education each year. Members are also expected to keep up with the changing technology and business environment to better serve their clients.\n",
    "7. **Professions monitor professional conduct** In order to maintain their profession's standing in society, professional bodies must monitor their members' actions and hold them accountable for violations of ethical standards.\n",
    "8. **Professions are collegial** Relationships between professional colleagues, even competitors, should be based on dignity and respect.\n",
    "9. **Professions are recognized oversight bodies** Professional bodies exercise oversight by developing standards of conduct and disciplining their members for failing to uphold them.\n",
    "10. **Professions encourage the engagement of members** Professional bodies rely on the active participation of their members, who should be willing to share their knowledge with colleagues and advance the organization's mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Professions Are Evolving\n",
    "Professions must evolve as new technologies emerge and society changes. In order to keep their policies and disciplinary processes current, professional organizations should consult regularly with non-members and seek a variety of viewpoints. Professional organizations may even adopt best practices from other unrelated professions, particularly with respect to ethics."

    "## Professionalism in Investment Management\n",
    "Compared to, for example, medicine and law, investment management is a relatively new profession that has yet to be as widely recognized by regulators and employers. Not all investment management practitioners have undertaken certified training or joined professional organizations that enforce ethical standards. This makes it more difficult for the investment management profession to gain the public's trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like many other fields, investment management does not have all of the characteristics of a profession. However, this is changing as practitioners are increasingly expected to demonstrate that their skills and knowledge have been independently certified. Additionally, globalization has put pressure on local professional organizations to work together toward the development of international standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investment professionals have a special responsibility because clients entrust them to protect the clients’ assets.\n",
    "### Trust in Investment Management\n",
    "Compliance with codes of ethics and professional standards is essential, and practice must be guided by **care, transparency, and integrity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like doctors and lawyers, investment professionals have access to a common body of knowledge, which they are expected to apply for the benefit of their clients and in accordance with relevant laws, regulations, and professional standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investment management firms have a role to play in creating their own policies for employees to follow. Professional organizations typically advise on how to manage conflicts between their standards and firm policies. **The investment management profession and investment firms must be interdependent to maintain trust. Employers and regulators have their own standards and practices, which may differ from regulations and standards set by professional bodies.**\n",
    "### CFA Institute as an Investment Management Professional Body\n",
    "CFA Institute (CFAI) is an example of a community with a code of ethics. Members and candidates commit to following CFAI's `Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct`."

    "## Ethical Conduct\n",
    "### Challenges to Ethical Conduct\n",
    "A professional may face situations that have no obvious or clear answer. That is where the study of ethics can be useful.\n",
    "#### Internal Traits\n",
    "Many people believe they are above average when it comes to ethical standards. Those that work in investment firms are no exception. Unfortunately, the public does not inherently trust investment professionals. This `overconfidence` in our own moral abilities can lead to poor decisions in unfamiliar situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also relevant is the natural instinct for self-preservation.\n",
    "#### Situational Influences\n",
    "`Situational influences` have a profound impact, either positive or negative, on our decisions and actions. These external factors include \n",
    "- What other people are doing around us (many strong people conform to social pressures in difficult situations). \n",
    "- Money and prestige are common situational influences in the investment industry (people understand the short-term effects of bonuses and promotions more than the long-term goal of contributing to the integrity of financial markets).\n",
    "- Loyalty to supervisors or organizations, fellow employees, and other colleagues can tempt individuals to make compromises and take actions that they would reject under different situational influences or judge harshly when taken by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Enron Corporation is an example of how situational influences can undermine a company. The focus on current revenues and the share price took precedence over the long-term sustainability of the company. Management wanted to maximize the value of their stock options. Accounting strategies were used to inflate revenues and hide debt. When this came to light, the stock price dropped from over US\\\\$90 to less than US$1 in just over a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compliance Policies/Programs \n",
    "Many firms develop strong compliance programs. However, just following rules may not be sufficient. The decision-maker must consider the larger picture in situations. (The focus should be on “What should I do?” rather than “What can I do?”)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consciously considering long-term consequences will help offset situational influences. We more easily recognize and consider short-term situational influences than longer-term considerations because longer-term considerations have fewer immediate consequences than situational influences do. When decision making is too narrowly focused on short-term factors, we tend to ignore longer-term risks and consequences, and the likelihood of poor ethical decision making increases. A strong compliance policy is a good first step toward developing an ethical culture; a focus on rules adherence may not be sufficient. Emphasis on compliance may not encourage decision makers to consider the larger picture and can **oversimplify decision making**. Taken to the extreme, a strong compliance culture can become another situational influence that blinds employees to other important considerations. An overconfidence bias can place too much importance on internal traits and intrinsic motivations, such as “I’m honest and would not lie,” even though studies have shown that internal traits are generally not the main determinant of whether or not someone will behave ethically in a given situation."

    "## Ethical vs. Legal Standards\n",
    "Stakeholders sometimes have different perspectives on what is ethical or beneficial. Laws and regulations codify ethical actions that benefit society or specific groups of stakeholders. Some actions are legal but not ethical, while others are ethical but not legal. For example,\n",
    "- Insider trading may be legal in some jurisdictions, but that does not make it ethical.\n",
    "- Whistleblowing may be illegal yet ethical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing rules and regulations in the investment industry will not necessarily increase trust in the financial markets. Laws typically follow market practices and take much time to implement. Also, laws vary by jurisdiction and are subject to interpretation. Good ethics require good judgment.\n",
    "## Ethical Decision-Making Frameworks\n",
    "**Laws, regulations, professional standards, and codes of ethics** can all help practitioners make good decisions, but **individual judgment** is critical. To increase the ability and motivation of market participants to act ethically:\n",
    "- Adopting a code of ethics is a good first step. \n",
    "  - clearly lays out the ethical principles that guide the thought processes and conduct the firm expects from its employees\n",
    "- Building a culture of integrity and accountability in the workplace (development, maintenance, and demonstration of a strong culture of integrity within the firm by senior management may be the single most important factor in promoting ethical behavior among the firm’s employees).\n",
    "- Skills must be developed so investment professionals can make the right decisions on a daily basis. \n",
    "- Investment professionals need a set of principles to use while making decisions. This can help them avoid indecisiveness and unethical conduct. It can be used to avoid and manage conflicts of interest. \n",
    "- Situations must be seen from **multiple perspectives**. It is especially important to have a **long-term perspective**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ethical decision-making framework is interactive among different steps but can be divided into four phases. \n",
    "1. Identify \n",
    "  - relevant facts available;\n",
    "  - information that you may not have but would like to have to give yourself a more complete understanding of the situation; \n",
    "  - distinguish between facts and personal opinion, judgements, and biases;\n",
    "  - stakeholders, ethical principles, and conflicts of interest;\n",
    "2. Consider \n",
    "  - situational influences and (personal) biases;\n",
    "  - additional guidance;\n",
    "  - get additional guidance (and/or fresh perspectives) from trusted sources such as colleagues, friends, mentors, families, compliance department, or legal counsel, CFA Institute Code and Standards, and firm policies, etc. \n",
    "3. Decide and act on it.\n",
    "4. Reflect on whether the outcome was as anticipated.\n",
    "  - improve and if neccessary, look for alternative actions\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes cases can be complicated and multiple iterations may reveal that no totally acceptable solution can be created. Applying an ethical decision-making framework can help you evaluate the situation so you can make the best possible decision."

    "## Preface\n",
    "The `Standards of Practice Handbook (Handbook)` provides guidance for real ethical dilemmas and helps practitioners understand the Code and Standards.\n",
    "### Evolution of the CFA Institute Code and Standards\n",
    "The Code and Standards are revised approximately every five years. Major changes were made in 2005 (9th edition); the most recent revisions occurred in July of 2014. The CFA Institute realizes updates are necessary to keep it relevant.\n",
    "### Standards of Practice Handbook (Handbook)\n",
    "Updates to the Handbook coincide with updates to the Code and Standards, helping members apply the code. Members are urged to discuss the Code and Standards with their supervisors.\n",
    "### Summary of Changes in the Eleventh Edition\n",
    "Among others, there are three changes to the Standards of Professional Conduct, which recognize the importance of proper supervision, clear communications with clients, and the expanding educational programs of CFA Institute.\n",
    "### CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program (PCP)\n",
    "**CFA Institute members and candidates are required to follow the Code and Standards**. The `Professional Conduct Program (PCP)` and the `Disciplinary Review Committee (DRC)` enforce the Code and Standards based on the Rules of Procedure, which strive for a fair process to members and candidates and confidentiality of proceedings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Although the Board of Governors maintains oversight and responsibility for the Professional Conduct Program, the CFA Institute `Bylaws` and `Rules of Procedure` form the basic structure for enforcement of the Code and Standards.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Professional Conduct inquiries come from a number of sources:\n",
    "- members and candidates must self-disclose on the annual `Professional Conduct Statement` all matters that question their professional conduct, such as involvement in civil litigation or a criminal investigation or being the subject of a written complaint. \n",
    "- written complaints received by `Professional Conduct staff` can bring about an investigation. \n",
    "- CFA Institute staff may become aware of questionable conduct by a member or candidate through the media, regulatory notices, or another public source.\n",
    "- candidate conduct is monitored by proctors who complete reports on candidates suspected to have violated testing rules on exam day.\n",
    "- CFA Institute may also conduct analyses of scores and exam materials after the exam, as well as monitor online and social media to detect disclosure of confidential exam information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Both the Professional Conduct Staff and the Disciplinary Review Committee are responsible for determining whether a violation of the Code and Standards or testing policies has occurred and if so what sanction should be imposed.** When an inquiry is initiated, the Professional Conduct staff conducts an investigation that may include requesting a written explanation from the member or candidate; interviewing the member or candidate, complaining parties, and third parties; and collecting documents and records relevant to the investigation. Upon reviewing the material obtained during the investigation, the Professional Conduct staff may conclude the inquiry with no disciplinary sanction, issue a cautionary letter, or continue proceedings to discipline the member or candidate. If the Professional Conduct staff believes a violation of the Code and Standards or testing policies has occurred, the member or candidate has the opportunity to reject or accept any charges and the proposed sanctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Designated Officer can conclude with **no disciplinary sanction, a cautionary letter, or continued proceedings**. The member or candidate can accept or reject the proposed disciplinary sanction, with a rejection leading to a hearing panel. Consequences could lead to public censure or revocation of the CFA charter.\n",
    "### Adoption of the Code and Standards\n",
    "CFA Institute members and candidates are required to follow the `Code and Standards`. The CFA Institute encourages, but does not require, firms to adopt the Code and Standards. Firms can claim compliance but must state that compliance has not been verified by the CFA Institute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Asset Manager Code of Professional Conduct` was drafted specifically for firms. It is a voluntary code of conduct. The Asset Manager Code provides specific, practical guidelines for asset managers in six areas: \n",
    "- loyalty to clients\n",
    "- the investment process\n",
    "- trading\n",
    "- compliance\n",
    "- performance evaluation\n",
    "- disclosure\n",
    "\n",
    "The SPC continually evaluates the Code and Standards, as well as the guidance in the Handbook, to ensure that they are\n",
    "- representative of high standards of professional conduct,\n",
    "- relevant to the changing nature of the investment profession,\n",
    "- globally applicable,\n",
    "- sufficiently comprehensive, practical, and specific,\n",
    "- enforceable, and\n",
    "- testable for the CFA Program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics and the Investment Industry\n",
    "Unethical behavior erodes and destroys trust. Investors with low levels of trust are less willing to accept risk and, therefore, will likely demand a higher return for the use of their capital. They may also choose to invest elsewhere or to not invest at all."

    "## Standard I: Professionalism\n",
    "### Standard I(A): Knowledge of the Law\n",
    "**Members and Candidates must understand and comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations (including the CFA Institute Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct) of any government, regulatory organization, licensing agency, or professional association governing their professional activities. In the event of a conflict, Members and Candidates must comply with the more strict law, rule, or regulation. Members and Candidates must not knowingly participate or assist in and must dissociate from any violation of such laws, rules, or regulations.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Guidance\n",
    "Members and candidates must comply with all applicable laws and regulations. They must adhere to the more strict law, rule, or regulation in all circumstances and not knowingly participate in any violations of such laws. Members are not required to become compliance experts but should know how to access compliance guidance.\n",
    "##### Relationship between the Code and Standards and Applicable Law\n",
    "Members and candidates must compare applicable laws with the Code and Standards and follow the one that is more strict. The “more strict\" one provides more protection to the client.\n",
    "##### Participation in or Association with Violations by Others\n",
    "Members and candidates are responsible for violations for which they knowingly participate. The member should first try to stop clients and employers from engaging in illegal or unethical behavior, which may entail reporting the violations to a supervisor. If this does not work, the member or candidate should dissociate from the activity, which could include leaving his or her employment. Reporting violations of others is encouraged by the Code and Standards but not required. Code and Standards **do not compel** members or candidates to report violations to **governmental or regulatory authorities** unless required to do so by law.\n",
    "##### Investment Products and Applicable Laws\n",
    "Members creating investment products should know where they originated and are sold. The applicable laws and regulations of both regions should be understood and adhered to. Members and candidates must compare applicable regulations with the Code and Standards and follow the stricter one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommended Procedures for Compliance\n",
    "##### Members and candidates\n",
    "Members and candidates should stay informed regarding laws and regulations through compliance department advice or continuing education. They should also regularly review the firm's compliance procedures and keep reference copies of applicable laws and rules readily available.\n",
    "##### Distribution Area Laws\n",
    "Members and candidates should also seek to understand the laws where investment products originated and are sold.\n",
    "##### Legal Counsel\n",
    "Members and candidates should seek legal counsel when necessary but should not blindly follow the legal advice.\n",
    "##### Dissociation\n",
    "When dissociating from an activity, the member should document the attempts to stop the action in question.\n",
    "##### Firms\n",
    "Firms should adopt a code of ethics, provide information on applicable laws, and establish procedures for reporting violations."

    "### Standard I(B): Independence and Objectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Members and Candidates must use reasonable care and judgment to achieve and maintain independence and objectivity in their professional activities. Members and Candidates must not offer, solicit, or accept any gift, benefit, compensation, or consideration that reasonably could be expected to compromise their own or another’s independence and objectivity.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Guidance\n",
    "Investors must be able to trust that they are receiving unbiased opinions and recommendations. Members and candidates must not accept any benefit that could compromise their own objectivity or offer any benefit that would compromise someone else's. Even the appearance of a conflict of interest can be detrimental.\n",
    "- What is a \"benefit\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Benefits may include gifts, tickets, invitations to lavish functions, or even allocations to oversubscribed IPOs for a personal account. Benefits may be provided indirectly. For example, a company may invite analysts to speak at sponsored events, or a broker may donate to a portfolio manager's preferred charity in order to secure additional business.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are all gifts and benefits from outside parties prohibited?\n",
    "\n",
    "    While it is permissible to accept modest gifts and entertainment, this should be consistent with an employer's policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are gifts and benefits from clients prohibited?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Gifts from clients could be acceptable due to the nature of the relationship. For example, a portfolio manager would violate this Standard by accepting a vacation from a broker to secure a business relationship. In that case, the manager's personal interest in a vacation has been prioritized above what may be in the best interests of the investors whose assets are being managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    However, it may be acceptable for a portfolio manager to accept a vacation from a client as a reward for superior performance because their interests are aligned (at least in theory). Managers must act in the interests of their clients and accepting gifts from clients does not alter their motivation to do so. This practice could be problematic if clients who gave gifts received preferential treatment at the expense of other clients. **Any gifts or benefits that are accepted from clients must be reported to one's employer.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relevance of this Standard: Sell-Side Research\n",
    "This Standard is particularly relevant for sell-side analysts covering companies that have issued publicly-traded securities. Concerns about independence and objectivity are even greater for analysts who work in large, diversified firms with other lines of business (e.g., investment banking, brokerage). Specific issues of relevance are discussed below:\n",
    "- **Buy-Side Clients**: Institutional clients are traditionally the primary users of sell-side research, either directly or with soft dollar brokerage. Portfolio managers may have significant positions in the security of a company under review. Portfolio managers are major consumers of sell-side research and they often have large long positions in companies that analysts are covering. Negative ratings can adversely affect the performance of these positions and, by extension, managerial compensation. Sell-side analysts should be mindful of any efforts on the part of buy-side clients to influence their opinions on companies. Portfolio managers must never seek to entice or coerce sell-side analysts into changing their opinions.\n",
    "- **Fund Manager and Custodial Relationships**: \n",
    "- **Investment Banking Relationships**: Large financial institutions may offer to provide analyst coverage as an incentive to secure the investment banking business. While it is not a violation of this Standard to cover prospective clients, analysts must take measures to ensure that their work is unbiased. Interactions between research analysts and investment banking staff should be monitored, investment banking staff should not be permitted to influence research reports, and analyst compensation should not be directly linked to the performance of investment banking clients.\n",
    "- **Public companies**: Managers of public companies may exert pressure on analysts by, for example, banning those who have issued negative recommendations from participating in conference calls. Analysts may have a positive bias in order to maintain their access to high-quality information.\n",
    "- **Travel Funding**: Analysts can often gain valuable information about the companies that they cover by traveling to their facilities or meeting with their executives. Such travel is consistent with the standards but all travel expenses (e.g., airfare, accommodation) should be covered by analysts personally or their firms in order to maintain objectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An exception can be made if no commercial transportation options are available, for example, if a mining company arranges for analysts to visit one of its operations in a remote location. However, any sponsored travel and accommodation arrangements should be modest. For example, flying on a corporate jet can compromise the independence of an analyst's opinions about the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relevance of this Standard: Issuer-Paid Research\n",
    "- **Issuer-Paid Research**: Investors feel more comfortable holding the stocks of companies that receive ongoing coverage from many analysts. Companies that receive little or no regular coverage may choose to hire independent analysts to produce reports. Such arrangements create an obvious conflict of interest because the analyst is being paid by the company that is being evaluated.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Issuer-paid research is permissible as long as measures are taken to protect the analyst's independence and proper disclosures are made. Specifically, **analysts should not accept an assignment until they have negotiated a `flat fee` that is not linked to their conclusions or recommendations**. Accepting compensation in the form of warrants or options will create an incentive to mislead investors with an unduly positive report. Details of the arrangement, including the nature of the compensation, should be disclosed in the report.\n",
    "- **Credit Rating Agency Opinions**: The credit rating model has the same conflicts as issuer-paid equity research because analysts are being compensated by the companies that they are evaluating. Credit analysts who work for rating agencies that offer other services (e.g., advising issuers on structured products) face the same kinds of `intra-firm pressures` as sell-side equity analysts who work to support their firms' investment banking teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relevance for Buy-Side Activities\n",
    "- **Manager Selection/Procurement**: Many institutional investors (e.g., pension funds) choose to allocate funds to third parties rather than manage their portfolios internally. Members and candidates who participate in the process of hiring outside managers (or any other service providers) should not accept gifts that might impair their decision-making.\n",
    "- **Performance Measurement and Attribution**: Buy-side performance analysts may receive offers of gifts or other benefits to skew their reports in ways that make outside managers look better. For example, a manager's benchmark may be altered to indicate that excess returns were generated. Members and candidates must not offer or accept benefits that would negatively impact the integrity of performance reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommended Procedures for Compliance\n",
    "To help members and candidates comply with this Standard, firms should take the following measures:\n",
    "1. Protect the integrity of opinions: \n",
    "2. Offer compensation packages that do not create incentives for biased reporting\n",
    "3. Create a restricted list: Restrict the use of special arrangements in which corporate issuers cover analysts' travel costs\n",
    "4. Restrict special cost arrangements\n",
    "5. Limit gifts\n",
    "6. **Provide only factual information about corporate clients if they are unwilling to allow negative opinions**\n",
    "7. Establish policies about accepting gifts from third parties and clients\n",
    "8. Restrict investments:  Restrict employee participation in IPOs and private placements\n",
    "9. Review procedures\n",
    "10. Independence policy: Adopt a formal independence policy\n",

    "#### Guidance\n",
    "Members and candidates should not knowingly make misrepresentations relating to investment analysis or any other professional activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors need to trust investment professionals. False and misleading oral and written statements undermine this trust. Websites and other materials should be kept current, particularly trying to avoid key omissions. Models should encompass a broad range of assumptions. An accidental mistake is not a violation but should be corrected immediately when discovered.\n",
    "##### Impact on Investment Practice\n",
    "Members should not misrepresent any aspect of their practice, including credentials and performance records. Care must be undertaken when using third-party information. Members may not imply external managers are their own. This standard prohibits guaranteeing specific returns on volatile investments. However, guarantees of other institutions such as insurance companies and banks can be disclosed to clients.\n",
    "##### Plagiarism\n",
    "Plagiarism is also prohibited with this standard, so members and candidates must acknowledge the source of the material. This clearly means taking research reports and resubmitting them as original work is wrong. Members must cite the source and include any qualifying statements. Sharing third-party research is acceptable, provided the source is disclosed. It is best to cite the original source. This standard also includes oral communication. In summary, the member must give credit where credit is due.\n",
    "##### Work Completed for Employer\n",
    "A member may use reports or models owned by the firm, even if the original analyst that created the report or model is no longer working at the firm.\n",
    "#### Recommended Procedures for Compliance\n",
    "Members should:\n",
    "- Factual Presentations: Understand their own and the firm's limitations and qualifications. It is best if the firm puts this in a written document.\n",
    "- Qualification Summary: Prepare a written summary of their qualifications and experience.\n",
    "- Verify Outside Information\n",
    "- Maintain Webpages: Verify distributed third-party information and regularly monitor published webpages.\n",
    "- Plagiarism Policy: Avoid plagiarism by maintaining copies of materials used to create research reports, attributing direct quotations to their sources, and giving credit to sources used for summary reports."

    "**Members and Candidates who possess material nonpublic information that could affect the value of an investment must not act or cause others to act on the information.**\n",
    "#### Guidance\n",
    "Members or candidates should not act or cause others to act on material nonpublic information relating to investments. Trading on inside information erodes market confidence, causing investors to think only insiders can profit in the market and thus choose not to invest. This standard prohibits any trading based on inside information, including derivative transactions.\n",
    "##### What is “Material” Information?\n",
    "Information is material if it would affect the security price or reasonable investors would want to know the information before making a buy or sell decision. The materiality of the information depends on the specificity of the information, the extent of its difference from public information, its nature, and its reliability. Examples include information on earnings, mergers, new products, or management changes. The **substance, specificity, and source** must be considered to determine materiality.\n",
    "##### What Constitutes “Nonpublic” Information?\n",
    "Information is nonpublic until it has been made available to the marketplace in general. One does not have to wait for the slowest method of delivery. **Information made available only to a select group of investors or analysts is nonpublic, so analysts must be aware of `selective disclosure`.**\n",
    "##### Mosaic Theory\n",
    "Under the `mosaic theory`, analysts are free to act on the consolidation of public and nonmaterial nonpublic information. Analysts seek to use all available information to add value to clients. Most of the information is gathered directly from the company, but the analyst should also talk to customers and suppliers. The insight of analysts enhances the efficiency of markets. The analyst should document research to prove material nonpublic information was not used.\n",
    "##### Using Industry Experts\n",
    "Some well-known analysts can affect market prices by simply issuing reports. This means the information would be deemed material by most investors. However, since it was **created from public information and paid for by clients**, the analyst is not required to make the report publicly available.\n",
    "#### Recommended Procedures for Compliance\n",
    "Seek public dissemination of information, usually by encouraging the issuing company to make the information public. If this does not work, the member or candidate should not act or cause others to act on the information.\n",
    "- Encourage the firm to adopt compliance procedures.\n",
    "- Encourage the firm to adopt disclosure procedures so information can be shared with the public in an equitable manner.\n",
    "- Encourage the firm to issue press releases before or right after analyst meetings.\n",
    "- Establish firewalls to limit the communication of material nonpublic information within the firm. Elements could include control of interdepartmental communications, review of employee trading, and limits on proprietary trading if in possession of material nonpublic information. Physical separation of departments can be beneficial.\n",
    "- Prevent personnel overlap between certain departments in multiservice firms, such as a bank's commercial lending with trust and research.\n",
    "- Establish a reporting system to review and approve communications between departments. A single compliance officer should have the authority to approve.\n",
    "- Monitor personal and `proprietary trading`. Employees should submit reports of personal trading. Securities should be placed on a restricted list when the firm has material nonpublic information.\n",
    "- Maintain written records of communication between departments. Proprietary trading procedures should be established. It is not appropriate to prohibit all proprietary trading when in possession of material nonpublic information. Market makers may still need to be passive to the market. It is more appropriate for arbitrage traders to cease activities.\n",
    "- Communicate compliance policies and guidelines to all employees."

    "#### Guidance\n",
    "Members and candidates must be loyal to clients and use prudent judgment. The interest of their clients should always be placed before their employer's or their own interests. Members and clients should use as much prudence as they would for their own investments. Prudence requires care, skill, and diligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regulatory and legal requirements will vary, but this standard transcends local laws and cultural differences.\n",
    "##### Understanding the Application of Loyalty, Prudence, and Care\n",
    "**Loyalty, prudence, and care** must always be adhered to by the member or candidate along with any legal or regulatory fiduciary obligations. There is more responsibility if the member has control of the client assets.\n",
    "##### Identifying the Actual Investment Client\n",
    "The member must first identify the client, who is always the ultimate beneficiary. This is not necessarily the person or entity that hires the member. **No client exists if the member is managing a fund to a stated mandate**. The member should strive to avoid conflicts of interest.\n",
    "##### Developing the Client’s Portfolio\n",
    "The client must trust the manager because the manager has **superior investment knowledge**. The manager must clearly explain the risks and potential rewards of investment strategies, disclosing any potential conflicts of interest. All investment decisions should be made in light of the total portfolio.\n",
    "##### Soft Commission Policies\n",
    "Investment managers sometimes choose brokerage services based on benefits received by themselves, such as research services. These `soft dollar arrangements` can harm the client because the broker chosen may charge high commissions without any direct benefit to the client. The member should make sure the soft dollar commission is used/charged for the benefit of the client. Some clients directly choose their own brokers through \"`directed brokerage`\". The member is obligated to disclose to the clients if they are not getting the \"best price\" from their brokers.\n",
    "##### Proxy Voting Policies\n",
    "The member has a duty of loyalty to vote proxies in an informed manner. The voting policies should be disclosed to clients.\n",
    "- Because of the time and expense involved in voting a proxy, Members and Candidates are not required to vote every proxy. A cost benefit analysis can be performed to determine if it is necessary to vote a proxy. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommended Procedures for Compliance\n",
    "If the member controls the client's assets, a statement should be sent to the client at least quarterly regarding the positions and transactions. The member should think from the client's perspective if uncertain about actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Members should encourage their firms to adopt policies regarding following applicable laws, establishing client investment objectives, considering all information, diversifying, conducting regular reviews, dealing fairly with clients, disclosing conflicts of interest and compensation arrangements, voting proxies, maintaining confidentiality, seeking the best execution, and placing the client’s interest first."

    "#### Guidance\n",
    "Members and candidates must deal fairly and objectively with all clients regarding investment advice or action and all other professional activities. The member should not favor one client over another. It is acceptable to provide different levels of services to clients for different fees, but this must be disclosed.\n",
    "##### Investment recommendations\n",
    "Investment recommendations must be disseminated such that **all clients have a fair opportunity to act**. This is challenging when different forms of communication are used (e.g., online reports, emails, phone calls). This is most critical for changes in recommendations, especially for clients that have acted on the original recommendations.\n",
    "##### Investment action\n",
    "Investment actions should also be done fairly for all clients. `Oversubscribed issues` should be prorated to all suitable clients. Also, clients should forgo personal and immediate family investments in oversubscribed issues. The allocation procedures should be disclosed to clients.\n",
    "#### Recommended Procedures for Compliance\n",
    "Members should encourage firms to establish compliance procedures regarding dealing fairly with clients. The following should be considered when making the procedures.\n",
    "- Limit how many people know a recommendation is forthcoming.\n",
    "- Shorten the time frame between decision and dissemination. A short conclusion could be published in advance of the full report.\n",
    "- Publish guidelines that prohibit people from taking action on pending recommendations.\n",
    "- Disseminate information to all clients at approximately the same time.\n",
    "- Maintain a list of clients and their holdings to aid in knowing who needs information.\n",
    "- Develop and document trade allocation procedures and disclose them to clients. This is especially important for block trades and new issues.\n",

    "Members and candidates should seek to understand their client's investment experience, risk and return objectives, and financial constraints.

If the member or candidate is responsible for managing a portfolio to a specific strategy, they must stay within the objectives and constraints.\n",

    "Determining suitability is judged using a prudent person approach. Even suitable investments may lose money.\n",
    "##### Developing an Investment Policy\n",
    "A written i`nvestment policy statement (IPS)` for each client should include financial circumstances, personal data, attitudes towards risk, and investment objectives. The IPS should also define the roles of advisors and be used to develop a strategic asset allocation.\n",
    "##### Understanding the Client’s Risk Profile\n",
    "The client's tolerance for risk must be measured and investment strategy risk should be quantified. The member and candidate should carefully consider leverage and limited liquidity.\n",
    "##### Updating an Investment’s Policy\n",
    "The IPS should be updated when any material changes occur and at least annually. The client's needs and circumstances will change over time. The suitability review is only valid if the client discloses all relevant information.\n",
    "##### The Need for Diversification\n",
    "Diversification is beneficial for most portfolios. Some managers are only responsible for a portion of the client's investments, so diversification must really be considered for the client's entire portfolio.\n",
    "##### Managing to an Index or Mandate\n",
    "Some members and candidates do not directly manage money for clients. Rather, they manage a fund based on an expected mandate. The manager must follow the objectives and constraints but is not responsible for determining the suitability for individual investors.\n",
    "#### Recommended Procedures for Compliance\n",
    "- The member or candidate should create an investment policy statement for each client. The IPS should identify the type of client, return and risk objectives, investment constraints (e.g., liquidity, time horizon, proxy voting), and performance measurement benchmarks.\n",
    "- The investor's objectives and constraints should be reviewed regularly (at least annually). Changes should influence asset allocation.\n",

    "Employers also have a responsibility to employees. Members can provide a copy of the Code and Standards to the employer. Employers are not obligated to follow the Code and Standards, but it is prudent for them not to have conflicting standards. Compensation plans should not encourage unethical behavior.\n",
    "##### Independent Practice\n",
    "Members should not engage in independent activities that compete with their employer. Members compensated for independent practice should provide details to their employer and gain approval before the commencement of activities. It is acceptable for a member to make preparations to begin such a practice before leaving the employer without prior approval.\n",
    "##### Leaving an Employer\n",
    "Members planning to leave an employer should not engage in competitive activities until the resignation is effective. The member should not misuse trade secrets or confidential information. The member also should not solicit the employer's clients prior to the resignation effective date. The employer must give written permission for the member to take records or files.\n",

The competition policy should be specified (such as non-compete agreements) while the member is an employee and after-termination policies should be established.

Reasonable supervision is determined on a case-by-case basis.\n",
    "##### System for Supervision\n",
    "The member must adopt procedures to help detect violations and ensure the procedures are being followed. A violation occurring does not necessarily mean the member did not meet this standard.\n",

In that case, the member should decline in writing to accept the supervisory responsibility especially if the inadequate compliance system prevents the member from discharging supervisory responsibilities. However, this standard would allow members and candidates to accept supervisory roles in circumstances when they believe their firm's compliance system is sub-standard and to use their influence in this position to improve the existing system. The member should enforce all policies equally, both investment-related and non-investment-related.\n",

A code of ethics contains broad principles that apply to all employees. It should be written in simple language that can be easily understood. The code of ethics should not explain the compliance procedures to avoid being overly complex. Instead, the compliance procedures should be presented as a separate document to help implement the code. The code of ethics should be shared with the clients to show that the firm is committed to conducting business in an ethical manner.\n",

    "Group consensus may not necessarily represent the view of the member or candidate even if they were a part of the group discussion. The member could still sign the report provided the process was thorough and independent.\n",
    "#### Recommended Procedures for Compliance\n",
    "Members and candidates should encourage firms to adopt procedures to support this standard. The firm should have a policy that requires all reports and recommendations to have a reasonable basis. A `review committee` could determine this based on written guidelines. **The quality of research should be based on measurable criteria and minimum levels of scenario testing**. Review by outside providers for reasonableness and adequacy and adopting standardized criteria for evaluating external advisers are also recommended.\n",
    "### Standard V(B): Communication with Clients and Prospective Clients\n",
    "Members and Candidates must:<br>\n",
    "- **Disclose to clients and prospective clients the basic format and general principles of the investment processes they use to analyze investments, select securities, and construct portfolios and must promptly disclose any changes that might materially affect those processes.**\n",
    "- **Disclose to clients and prospective clients significant limitations and risks associated with the investment process.**\n",
    "- **Use reasonable judgment in identifying which factors are important to their investment analyses, recommendations, or actions and include those factors in communications with clients and prospective clients.**\n",
    "- **Distinguish between fact and opinion in the presentation of investment analyses and recommendations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Guidance\n",
    "Members and candidates should clearly communicate the investment process to clients, highlighting the important factors and quickly disclosing material changes. They should also distinguish between fact and opinion when presenting investment analysis and recommendations to clients. Limitations should be disclosed. They should let clients know the most important factors. Important revisions in the investment policy statement should be disclosed to the clients and prospective clients as soon as possible.\n",
    "##### Informing Clients of the Investment Process\n",
    "Members should communicate changes in the investment process to clients along with the use of outside advisers. Communication can be done in-person, over the phone, through reports, or by any other means.\n",
    "##### Different Forms of Communication\n",
    "**Depending on the nature of client communication, members may NOT need to provide in-depth reports for all recommendations**. For instance, some recommendations can be in capsule form (e.g., a recommended stock list without much detail). In that case, members should notify clients that additional information is available from the author of the report.\n",
    "##### Report Presentation\n",
    "Members should make the reference material available for quantitative research. The final report should be clear for the reader, noting the limitations and risks considered. Unimportant details can be omitted to avoid distracting the clients.\n",
    "##### Distinction between Facts and Opinions in Reports\n",
    "The standard requires that facts and opinions must be clearly separated. Future estimates (such as earnings or dividends) must be clearly labeled as opinions. Limits of statistical projections must be mentioned.\n",
    "#### Recommended Procedures for Compliance\n",
    "Determining whether a member has used reasonable judgment must be decided on a case-by-case basis. The member should maintain records that justify recommendations and research.\n",
    "### Standard V(C): Record Retention\n",
    "**Members and Candidates must develop and maintain appropriate records to support their investment analyses, recommendations, actions, and other investment-related communications with clients and prospective clients.**\n",
    "#### Guidance\n",
    "Members and candidates must develop and maintain records to support any investment-related communications with clients, including handwritten notes or drafts that are relevant. Records can be stored in either hard copy or electronic form. Required records depend on the situation, but minimum standards are often imposed by local regulators. When there is no regulatory guidance, the CFA Institute recommends maintaining records for at least **seven years**.\n",
    "##### Records are Property of the Firm\n",
    "Records of the member are property of the firm. This means the member must have the approval of the employer to take them if employment at the firm ceases. The member may not use recommendations at a new firm if the supporting documentation is at the old firm."

    "## Standard VI: Conflicts of Interest\n",
    "### Standard VI(A): Disclosure of Conflicts\n",
    "**Members and Candidates must make full and fair disclosure of all matters that could reasonably be expected to impair their independence and objectivity or interfere with respective duties to their clients, prospective clients, and employer. Members and Candidates must ensure that such disclosures are prominent, are delivered in plain language, and communicate the relevant information effectively.**\n",
    "#### Guidance\n",
    "Members and candidates should clearly disclose all potential conflicts of interest to clients, prospective clients, and employer. While it is best to avoid conflicts of interest, some are inevitable, such as in compensation structures. Updates on conflicts should be made when necessary.\n",
    "##### Disclosure of Conflicts to Employers\n",
    "Members and candidates should follow employer guidelines and give sufficient information about conflicts. Anything that could cause a member to not act in the best interest of the employer should be reported. Even just the appearance of a conflict of interest can cause problems.\n",
    "##### Disclosure to Clients\n",
    "Objectivity is paramount in giving advice to clients. The relationship between the issuer and the member should always be disclosed. The member or candidate must strive to uncover any potential conflicts of interest that should be disclosed, including nonstandard fee structures.\n",
    "##### Cross-Departmental Conflicts\n",
    "Conflicts between departments can exist. For example, the marketing department may want an analyst to write a favorable opinion for a particular company's stock. Be careful regarding broker-sponsored limited partnerships.\n",
    "##### Conflicts with Stock Ownership\n",
    "A common conflict is the member's ownership of stock in companies that he or she recommends to clients. These should be clearly disclosed. However, stock exposures through large diversified mutual funds do not need to be disclosed unless disclosure is specifically required.\n",
    "##### Conflicts as a Director\n",
    "Director services can cause a conflict between the duties owed to clients and shareholders. Also, payment in the form of options could entice the member to strive to increase that stock price. Board members also are privy to material nonpublic information.\n",
    "#### Recommended Procedures for Compliance\n",
    "- Members or candidates should disclose special compensation arrangements. \n",
    "- Compensation packages should be in the firms' promotional literature. \n",
    "- Outstanding stock options should be revealed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard VI(B): Priority of Transactions\n",
    "**Investment transactions for clients and employers must have priority over investment transactions in which a Member or Candidate is the beneficial owner.**\n",
    "#### Guidance\n",
    "Investment transactions for clients and employers have priority over transactions for members or candidates. This is just an example of placing the interest of clients and employers ahead of their own.\n",
    "##### Avoiding Potential Conflicts\n",
    "It is acceptable for members to profit from personal investments provided the client is not disadvantaged, the trade is not for clients, and regulations are followed. A member may make a trade contrary to the recommendation of their firm (such as selling a security for personal cash needs).\n",
    "##### Personal Trading Secondary to Trading for Clients\n",
    "Personal transactions should never disadvantage client transactions. Members and clients having similar investments are often fine.\n",
    "##### Standards for Nonpublic Information\n",
    "Material nonpublic information should not be shared.\n",
    "##### Impact on All Accounts with Beneficial Ownership\n",
    "Clients and employers should have the right to act first on a recommendation. **Fee-paying family accounts should be treated like other client accounts.**\n",
    "#### Recommended Procedures for Compliance\n",
    "Policies at firms regarding personal investments are critical to prevent conflicts of interest. The procedures will vary by firm but should include the following:\n",
    "- Participation in equity IPOs should be limited because it could appear to take away opportunities from clients. Members should get the firm's approval in advance to participate in IPOs.\n",
    "- Limits should be placed on `private placement investments`. These are not often used for clients due to the high risk, but members could receive opportunities to invest in them as a reward from the broker. Also, there is an incentive to recommend the security when private placement goes public.\n",
    "- Investment personnel should not be allowed to \"`front-run`\" client trades. This can be prevented by `blackout` periods that prevent managers from trading. The firm must decide who must comply with restriction and what trading is precluded.\n",
    "- Reporting procedures should be established for investment personnel. The reporting requirements include disclosure of holdings, duplicate confirmations of transactions, and preclearance procedures.\n",
    "- Members should disclose personal trading policies to investors. This will reduce the concern of conflicts of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard VI(C): Referral Fees\n",
    "**Members and Candidates must disclose to their employer, clients, and prospective clients, as appropriate, any compensation, consideration, or benefit received from or paid to others for the recommendation of products or services.**\n",
    "#### Guidance\n",
    "Members and candidates must disclose to employers and clients any benefit received from or paid to others for the recommendation of products or services. This allows clients and employers to evaluate partiality and full cost. The member or candidate must fully describe the consideration or benefit, including type and amount. Firms should adopt clear procedures in this area.\n",
    "#### Recommended Procedures for Compliance\n",
    "Employers should develop procedures related to referral fees. Referral fees could be completely restricted or require appropriate steps for approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investment professionals should report to their employer at least quarterly to disclose the amount and nature of compensation received."

    "**Members and Candidates must not engage in any conduct that compromises the reputation or integrity of CFA Institute or the CFA designation or the integrity, validity, or security of CFA Institute programs.**\n",
    "#### Guidance\n",
    "Members and candidates must not do anything to compromise the reputation of the CFA Institute, CFA designation, or CFA Institute programs. They also must not adversely affect the integrity of the CFA examinations. Conduct standards address cheating or not following rules relating to the examination process, improperly using the CFA designation, and misrepresenting information on the Professional Conduct Statement.\n",
    "##### Confidential Program Information\n",
    "CFA examination content must be kept confidential, including specific questions tested and broad topics included or excluded. Nonconfidential information about the exam can be discussed. The CFA Institute monitors blogs and forums.\n",
    "##### Additional CFA Program Restrictions\n",
    "Exam candidates must follow all testing policies. Volunteers may not disclose confidential information. The CFA exam policies and procedures can be found here. Candidates are expected to be somewhat familiar with these policies before sitting for the exam.\n",
    "##### Expressing an Opinion\n",
    "Members and candidates are free to share personal opinions regarding the exam process.\n",
    "### Standard VII(B): Reference to CFA Institute, the CFA Designation, and the CFA Program\n",
    "**When referring to CFA Institute, CFA Institute membership, the CFA designation, or candidacy in the CFA Program, Members and Candidates must not misrepresent or exaggerate the meaning or implications of membership in CFA Institute, holding the CFA designation, or candidacy in the CFA Program.**\n",
    "#### Guidance\n",
    "Members and candidates must not misrepresent or exaggerate the meaning of membership in the CFA Institute, holding the CFA designation, or candidacy in CFA Program. One cannot imply superior performance over another just because they have a CFA designation, but promoting the ethics and professional conduct of the CFA Program is permitted. This standard applies to any form of communication.\n",
    "##### CFA Institute Membership\n",
    "To maintain CFA Institute membership, a member must fulfill the following requirements:\n",
    "1. Annually complete the Professional Conduct Statement.\n",
    "2. Pay applicable membership dues on an annual basis.\n",
    "3. Members who fail to meet these requirements are no longer considered active members and may not use the CFA designation until membership is reactivated.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Using the CFA Designation\n",
    "Using the CFA designation is encouraged for those that have earned it, but its meaning must not be exaggerated. CFA charterholders must maintain CFA Institute membership to continue using the CFA designation. The order of designations cited on items such as resumes and business cards is a matter of personal preference. \n",
    "##### Referring to Candidacy in the CFA Program\n",
    "Candidates may state that they are a candidate in the CFA Program but cannot imply any partial designation. A candidate is one who is enrolled for a specified exam or is waiting on results from a recent exam. A candidate can state which exams have been passed but cannot insinuate passing quickly implies superior ability.\n",
    "##### Proper Usage of the CFA Marks\n",
    "A CFA charterholder can use Chartered Financial Analyst®, CFA®, and the CFA Logo. The Chartered Financial Analyst and CFA marks cannot be used as nouns; rather, they are adjectives that describe an individual or group of people. The CFA mark should always be capitalized, have no periods, and not be given more prominence (such as larger or bolder) than the charterholder's name.\n",
    "#### Recommended Procedures for Compliance\n",
    "Members and candidates should learn these requirements to avoid violations. Templates can be created by the firm to promote compliance and consistency."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Why Were the GIPS Created\n",
    "The GIPS standards are a practitioner-driven set of **ethical principles** that establish a standardized, industry-wide approach for investment firms to follow in calculating and presenting their historical investment results to **`prospective clients`**. The GIPS standards ensure fair representation and full disclosure of investment performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many are interested in historical investment results. In the past, the varying methods and accuracy made comparisons difficult. Misleading practices included:\n",
    "- `Representative Accounts`: Selecting a top-performing portfolio to represent the firm’s overall investment results for a specific mandate.\n",
    "- `Survivorship Bias`: Showing average performance that excludes weak portfolios that have been terminated.\n",
    "- `Varying Time Periods`: Using time periods that are arbitrary and favorable to the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparisons were difficult even among ethical firms. \n",
    "### Who can Claim Compliance?\n",
    "Any investment management firm that actually manages assets can choose to `comply` with the GIPS standards, although regulators rarely require it. Plan sponsors and consultants can make a `claim of compliance` if they actually manage assets for which they are making a claim of compliance. (They can claim to endorse the Standards and/or require that their investment managers comply with the Standards.)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Firm-wide compliance` is required – following just some GIPS standards or using GIPS for only a segment of the firm assets is not allowed. \n",
    "### Who Benefits from Compliance?\n",
    "Investment management firms that comply give confidence to prospective clients and enable the firm to compete worldwide for business (e.g. `competitive bidding`). Internal controls are also enhanced. Prospective clients benefit as investors because they can more easily compare historical track records.\n",
    "## Composites\n",
    "One of the key concepts of the Standards is the required use of composites. \n",
    "\n",
    "A `composite` is an `aggregation` of one or more portfolios managed according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy. A composite must include all **actual, fee-paying, discretionary portfolios** managed in accordance with the same **investment mandate, objective, or strategy**. *(Note: In a `non-discretionary portfolio`, the broker might recommend the available purchase and selling ideas to the client but he or she will never do any transaction without the consent of the client. Non-discretionary portfolios must not be included in a firm’s composites.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, if a GIPS-compliant firm presents its track record for a Global Equity Composite (the Composite), the Composite must include all portfolios that are managed, or have historically been managed, in the firm’s Global Equity strategy. The firm may not subjectively select which Global Equity portfolios will be included in or excluded from the calculation and presentation of the Global Equity Composite. \n",
    "    \n",
    "When a firm changes its organizational structure, historical composite results cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The determination of which portfolios to include in the Composite should be done according to pre-established criteria (i.e., on an `ex-ante basis`), not after the fact. This prevents a firm from including only their best-performing portfolios in the Composite.\n",
    "## Verification\n",
    "Firms that claim compliance with the GIPS standards are responsible for their claim of compliance and for maintaining that compliance. *(That is, firms `self-regulate` their claim of compliance.)* \n",
    "\n",
    "Once a firm claims compliance with the Standards, they may voluntarily hire an independent third party to perform a `verification` in order to increase confidence in the firm’s claim of compliance. Verification may also increase the knowledge of the firm’s performance measurement team and improve the consistency and quality of the firm’s `compliant presentations`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Verification is performed with respect to an entire firm, not on specific composites. **Verification does not ensure the accuracy of any specific composite presentation.** Verification tests:\n",
    "- whether the investment firm has complied with all the composite construction requirements of the GIPS standards on a firm-wide basis, and\n",
    "- whether the firm’s policies and procedures are designed to calculate and present performance in compliance with the GIPS standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Verification must be performed by an independent third party. \n",
    "- additional credibility to a firm’s claim of compliance.\n",
    "- may provide existing and prospective clients with greater assurance \n",
    "- may also provide improved internal processes and procedures\n",
    "- marketing advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Structure of the GIPS Standards\n",
    "The provisions within the 2010 edition of the GIPS standards are divided into nine sections: \n",
    "1. Fundamentals of Compliance\n",
    "2. Input Data\n",
    "3. Calculation Methodology\n",
    "4. Composite Construction\n",
    "5. Disclosure\n",
    "6. Presentation and Reporting\n",
    "7. Real Estate\n",
    "8. Private Equity\n",
    "9. Wrap Fee/`Separately Managed Account (SMA)` Portfolios. \n",

    "## Background \n",
    "### Why is a Global Investment Performance Standard Needed?\n",
    "- Standardized Investment Performance: The globalization of investment management increases the need for a standardized investment reporting process.\n",
    "- Global Passport: Since regulation and performance reporting varies tremendously by country, established standards will aid asset managers and clients to evaluate performance.\n",
    "- Investor Confidence: Firms that follow standards are more likely to have performance information that is trusted by clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "The GIPS Executive Committee has several goals. They want to:\n",
    "- To establish investment industry best practices for calculating and presenting investment performance;\n",
    "- To obtain worldwide acceptance of a single standard for the calculation and presentation of investment performance based on the principles of fair representation and full disclosure;\n",
    "- To promote the use of accurate and consistent investment performance data;\n",
    "- To encourage fair, global competition among investment firms **without creating barriers to entry**; and\n",
    "- To foster the notion of industry “self-regulation” on a global basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of GIPS\n",
    "Key features of the GIPS standards include the following:\n",
    "- The GIPS standards are **ethical standards** for investment performance presentation to ensure **fair representation** and **full disclosure** of investment performance. \n",
    "- Meeting the objectives of fair representation and full disclosure is likely to require more than simply adhering to the minimum requirements of the GIPS standards. Firms should also adhere to the **recommendations** to achieve best practice in the **calculation** and presentation of performance.\n",
    "- The GIPS standards require firms to include all **actual, discretionary, fee-paying portfolios** in at least one composite defined by investment mandate, objective, or strategy *(in order to prevent firms from cherry-picking their best performance)*.\n",
    "- The GIPS standards rely on the **integrity of input data**. \n",
    "  - The accuracy of input data is critical to the accuracy of the performance presentation. \n",
    "  - The underlying valuations of portfolio holdings drive the portfolio’s performance.  \n",
    "  - The GIPS standards require firms to adhere to **certain calculation methodologies** and to make specific disclosures along with the firm’s performance.\n",
    "- Firms must comply with all requirements of the GIPS standards, including any updates, Guidance Statements, interpretations, Questions & Answers (Q&As), and clarifications published by CFA Institute and the GIPS Executive Committee, which are available on the [GIPS website](www.gipsstandards.org) as well as in the GIPS Handbook.\n",
    "- Historically, the GIPS standards focused primarily on returns. The 2010 edition of the GIPS standards includes new provisions related to risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Historical Performance Record\n",
    "A firm is required to initially present, at a minimum, five years of annual investment performance that is compliant with the GIPS standards. If the firm or the composite has been in existence less than five years, the firm must present performance since the firm’s inception or the composite inception date.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a firm presents a minimum of five years of GIPS-compliant performance (or for the period since the firm’s inception or the composite inception date if the firm or the composite has been in existence less than five years), the firm must present an additional year of performance each year, building up to **a minimum of 10 years** of GIPS-compliant performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional years must be added up to 10 years. Firms can link non-GIPS-compliant performance for periods prior to 1/1/2000.\n",
    "    Firms may link non-GIPS-compliant performance to their GIPS-compliant performance provided that **only GIPS-compliant performance is presented for periods after 1 January 2000** and the firm discloses the periods of non-compliance. Firms must not link non-GIPS-compliant performance for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2000 to their GIPS-compliant performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firms that manage private equity, real estate, and/or wrap fee/separately managed account (SMA) portfolios must also comply with Sections 6, 7, and 8, respectively, of the Provisions of the GIPS standards that became effective as of 1 January 2006.\n",
    "#### Effective Date\n",
    "The effective date for the 2010 edition of the GIPS standards is **1 January 2011**. Compliant presentations that include performance for periods that begin on or after 1 January 2011 must be prepared in accordance with the 2010 edition of the GIPS standards. Prior editions of the GIPS standards may be found on the [GIPS website](www.gipsstandards.org).\n",
    "#### Implementing a Global Standard\n",
    "A local `sponsoring organization` is essential to support GIPS standards within a country. The sponsor can ensure the country's interests are taken into account. (sponsoring organizations lack the authority to sanction firms that falsely claim compliance with the GIPS standards.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-regulation requires strong ethics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regulators should recognize the benefits of voluntary compliance, take enforcement action against firms that falsely claim compliance, and encourage third-party verification. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firms must comply with laws rather than GIPS standards if the two conflict. When there is a discrepancy between the laws and the GIPS standards, it needs to be disclosed in the GIPS-compliant presentation."

    "## Provisions of Global Investment Performance Standards \n",
    "### Section 0. Fundamentals of Compliance\n",
    "Several core principles create the foundation for the GIPS standards, including properly defining the firm, providing compliant presentations to all prospective clients, adhering to applicable laws and regulations, and ensuring that information presented is not false or misleading. Two important issues that a firm must consider when becoming compliant with the GIPS standards are \n",
    "- the definition of the firm and the firm’s definition of discretion. The definition of the firm is the foundation for firm-wide compliance and creates defined boundaries whereby total firm assets can be determined. The firm’s definition of discretion establishes criteria to judge which portfolios must be included in a composite and is based on the firm’s ability to implement its investment strategy. The Fundamentals of Compliance recommend that firms should adopt the broadest, most meaningful definition of the firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "total firm assets must include assets assigned to a `sub-advisor` provided the firm has discretion over selecting the sub-advisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Global Investment Performance Standards require that firms be defined as an **investment firm, subsidiary, or division held out to clients or prospective clients as a distinct business entity** (0.A.12).\n",
    "\n",
    "GIPS Provision 0.A.7, statements referring to the calculation methodology as being “in accordance”, “in compliance”, or “consistent” with the Global Investment Performance Standards, or similar statements, are prohibited.\n",
    "### Section 1. Input Data\n",
    "Consistency of input data used to calculate performance is critical to effective compliance with the GIPS standards and establishes the foundation for full, fair, and comparable investment performance presentations. For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011, all portfolios must be valued in accordance with the definition of fair value and the GIPS Valuation Principles.\n",
    "### Section 2. Calculation Methodology\n",
    "Certain calculation methodologies are mandated by GIPS standards.\n",
    "### Section 3. Composite Construction\n",
    "A composite is an aggregation of one or more portfolios with similar investment mandates. The composite return is the asset-weighted average of the performance.\n",
    "### Section 4. Disclosure\n",
    "Disclosure allows the firm to provide context to the performance. Some disclosures are required, one of which is the claim of compliance. The firm must also indicate if it has or has not been verified.\n",
    "### Section 5. Presentation and Reporting\n",
    "GIPS standards include reporting requirements, but the firm must realize the requirements could never cover all situations.\n",
    "### Section 6. Real Estate\n",
    "Real estate is treated separately and some of the provisions in Sections 0-5 above will not apply. The 2010 edition of the GIPS standards includes new provisions for closed-end real estate funds.\n",
    "### Section 7. Private Equity\n",
    "Private equity is also treated separately and some of the provisions in Sections 0-5 above will not apply.\n",
    "### Section 8. Wrap Fee / Separately Managed Account (SMA) Portfolios\n",
    "This section supplements Sections 0-5. Provisions in Sections 0-5 that do not apply are noted."
