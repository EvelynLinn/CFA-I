    "# Fixed-Income Securities: Defining Elements\n",
    "Fixed-income securities (or `debt securities` or `bonds`) are the dominant means of raising capital. It is a way for corporations to borrow without relinquishing ownership. Investors use them to diversify equity risk and fund known payment streams.\n",
    "### Basic Feature of Bonds\n",
    "#### Issuer\n",
    "Entities that raise capital by issuing debt include \n",
    "- companies, \n",
    "- national (sovereign) governments, \n",
    "- sub-national (non-sovereign) governments: non-sovereign bonds are typically repaid from the issuer’s taxing authority or the cash flows of the project being financed\n",
    "- quasi-government agencies, and \n",
    "- supranational organizations (e.g., World Bank): The source of payment for bonds issued by supranational organizations is either the repayment of previous loans made by the organization or the paid-in capital of its member states. \n",
    "- Special purpose entities that are created to securitize assets (e.g., mortgage-backed securities) are typically treated as another type of issuer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Maturity\n",
    "The maturity date is the due date of the principal. The tenor is the time remaining until maturity. A 10-year bond issued 2 years ago has an 8-year tenor. Maturities range from overnight to 30+ years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Money market securities have maturities of less than one year, while longer-dated debt trades in the capital market. Perpetual bonds have no stated maturity. *The primary difference between a money market security and a capital market security is the maturity at issuance. Money market securities mature in one year or less, whereas capital market securities mature in more than one year.*\n",
    "#### Par Value\n",
    "The par value (or `principal amount` or `face value`) is the amount that must be repaid at maturity. Often the price of a bond is quoted as a percentage of the par value. Bonds selling below the par value are at a discount and bonds selling above the par value are at a premium.\n",
    "#### Coupon Rate and Frequency\n",
    "The issuer agrees to pay the coupon rate (`nominal rate`) each year. For example, a 5% coupon bond with a $1,000 par value pays $50 in coupons annually. If the frequency is annual, bondholders will receive a single $50 payment at the end of each year. If the frequency is semi-annual, the same bond would pay $25 coupons every six months until maturity. Mortgage-backed securities typically pay monthly coupons.\n",
    "- `Conventional bonds` pay a fixed interest rate, while \n",
    "- `Floating-rate notes` have coupon rates that change based on the performance of a reference rate (e.g., Libor). For example, a floating rate bond with a coupon rate of Libor + 1% will pay a 5% coupon if Libor is at 4%. If Libor falls to 2%, the bond's next coupon payment will be for 3% of par value. These spreads are often quoted in terms of `basis points`, which is 0.01%. Libor + 1% can be stated as Libor + 100 basis points.\n",
    "- A `zero-coupon bond` is called a pure discount bond because no coupons are paid. Instead, investors purchase these securities at a discount and receive their par value at maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Currency Denomination\n",
    "Bonds can be denominated in any currency, issuers are not required to use their domestic currency. Indeed, many foreign bond issues are denominated in USD or EUR to attract a wider pool of investors.\n",
    "- `Dual-currency issues` make coupon payments in one currency and principal payments in another. \n",
    "- `Currency option bonds` give bondholders the right to choose which of two currency denominations they prefer for coupons and principal repayments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Yield Measures\n",
    "A bond's price is inversely related to its yield (i.e., a higher yield results in a lower price). Commonly-quoted yield measures include:\n",
    "#### Current Yield\n",
    "(a.k.a. `running yield`) is the annual coupon divided by the bond’s current price. The current yield is a measure of income that is analogous to the dividend yield for a common share.\n",
    "$$Current\\ Yield(as\\ \\%)=\\frac{Annual\\ Coupon}{Current\\ Price}$$\n",
    "$Annual\\ Coupon=Par\\ Value \\times Coupon\\ Rate$\n",
    "#### Yield to Maturity\n",
    "It is the internal rate of return (discount rate) that makes the present value of a bond's future cash flows equal to its current price. Also known as `redemption yield` or `yield to redemption`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The yield to maturity can be considered an estimate of the bond’s expected return; it reflects the annual return that an investor will earn on a bond if this investor purchases the bond today and holds it until maturity. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Risks\n",
    "Bondholders are exposed to `credit risk`—that is, the risk of loss resulting from the issuer failing to make full and timely payments of *interest* and/or repayments of *principal*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Systemic risk is the risk of failure of the financial system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interest rate risk is the risk that a change in market interest rate affects a bond’s value."

    "## Legal and Regulatory and Tax Considerations\n",
    "### Bond Indenture\n",
    "The `trust deed` (or `bond indenture`) describes the obligations of the bond issuer and the rights of the bondholders. It specifies the principal value, coupon rate, maturity date, covenants, contingency provisions, collateral, and credit enhancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The indenture is held by a `trustee`, which is typically a financial institution. The trustee is appointed by the issuer but acts in a fiduciary capacity for bondholders. The trustee duties are mainly administrative (e.g., maintaining records) unless a default occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Legal Identity of the Bond Issuer and its Legal Form\n",
    "A bond's issuer has contractual obligations to its bondholders. The indenture specifies exactly which legal entity is bound by the terms of the contract. For example, a parent company is not responsible for bonds issued by its subsidiaries unless this has been specified in the indenture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial institutions often create legally-separate special purpose entities (SPEs) as vehicles for securitizing their assets. This entity is typically thinly capitalized with no independent managers, but it owns the underlying assets that have been transferred from sponsoring financial institution. SPEs are bankruptcy-remote, meaning that the sponsor's creditors have no claim to the securitized assets.\n",
    "#### Source of Repayment Proceeds\n",
    "The indenture describes how the issuer will make interest and principal payments. Sovereign bonds are backed by national governments that have the authority to tax their citizens and print money. Non-sovereign government issuers may be able to service their debt obligations issues through general taxes, project cash flows, or special taxes. Corporate bonds are repaid with operating cash flows, while securitizations rely on cash flows from a pool of underlying assets.\n",
    "#### Asset or Collateral Backing and Seniority Ranking\n",
    "Investors must understand how they rank relative to other creditors. Senior debt has a higher claim than subordinated debt in the event of a bankruptcy. Similarly secured bonds rank above unsecured bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Secured bonds** are backed by collateral that lenders can claim if the issuer defaults on its obligations. Collateral may be specifically identified assets. For example, \n",
    "  - `collateral trust bonds` are secured by financial assets (*securities, such as common shares, other bonds*), and \n",
    "  - `equipment trust certificates` are secured by physical assets. Alternatively, collateral can be broadly defined as \"general plant and equipment.\"\n",
    "2. **Unsecured bonds** have no collateral; bondholders have only a general claim on the issuer’s assets and cash flows.\n",
    "3. **Debentures** typically refers to secured bonds in the UK and its former colonies and unsecured bonds in the rest of the world.\n",
    "4. **Covered bonds** are like asset-backed securities in that a financial institution creates a segregated pool of assets (e.g., loans). However, these assets remain on the financial institution's `balance sheet`. If one of the assets stops generating cash flows, the issuer must replace it with a performing asset. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Credit Enhancements\n",
    "Internal and external credit enhancements can be used to reduce credit risk. Internal credit enhancements include \n",
    "- `subordination` (`credit tranching`) (through waterfall structure): the cash flows generated by the assets are allocated with different priority to tranches of different seniority. \n",
    "- `over-collateralization`: posting more collateral than is needed to obtain or secure financing. \n",
    "- `reserve accounts` or `reserve funds`: two types of this include \n",
    "  - cash reserve fund, is a deposit of cash that can be used to absorb losses.\n",
    "  - excess spread account(s) (`excess interest cash flow`), allocation into an account of any amounts left over after paying out the interest to bondholders. (related: turboing)\n",
    "\n",
    "External credit enhancements such as \n",
    "- `surety bonds`: Bank guarantees and surety bonds are very similar in nature because they both reimburse bondholders for any losses incurred if the issuer defaults. However, there is usually a maximum amount that is guaranteed, called the penal sum. The major difference between a bank guarantee and a surety bond is that the former is issued by a bank, whereas the latter is issued by a rated and regulated insurance company.\n",
    "- bank guarantees\n",
    "- letters of credit or guarantees from financial institutions: The financial institution provides the issuer with a credit line to reimburse any cash flow shortfalls from the assets backing the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bank guarantees, surety bonds, and letters of credit expose the investor to third-party (or counterparty) risk—that is, the possibility that a guarantor cannot meet its obligations. A `cash collateral account` mitigates this concern because the issuer immediately borrows the `credit-enhancement amount` and then invests that amount, usually in highly rated short-term commercial paper. Because a cash collateral account is an actual deposit of cash rather than a pledge of cash, a downgrade of the cash collateral account provider will not necessarily result in a downgrade of the bond issue backed by that provider.\n",
    "#### Covenants\n",
    "Covenants are clauses that specify the rights of the bondholders and any actions that the issuer is obligated to perform or prohibited from performing. They include both `affirmative (positive)` and `negative covenants`. \n",
    "- Affirmative covenants are usually administrative in nature. \n",
    "- Negative covenants typically restrict the issuer in areas such as additional debt issuance, changing claims on assets, shareholder distributions, asset disposals, risky investments, and mergers and acquisitions."

    "### Legal and Regulatory Considerations\n",
    "The global bond markets consist of **national bond markets** and the **Eurobond market**. A national bond market includes all the bonds that are issued and traded in a specific country and denominated in the currency of that country. \n",
    "- Bonds issued by entities that are incorporated in that country are called domestic bonds, whereas \n",
    "- Bonds issued by entities that are incorporated in another country are called foreign bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign bond nicknames:\n",
    "- “kangaroo bonds” in Australia\n",

    "- “matrioshka bonds” in Russia\n",
    "- “matador bonds” in Spain\n",
    "- “bulldog bonds” in the United Kingdom\n",
    "- and “Yankee bonds” in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Legal and regulatory requirements vary greatly by jurisdiction, so the location of issuance and trading matters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Eurobonds are traded on the Eurobond market and are typically less regulated. These bonds are named after the currency in which they are denominated in. *they are named after the currency in which they are denominated. For example, Eurodollar and Euroyen bonds are denominated in US dollars and Japanese yens, respectively. Bonds that are denominated in euros are called euro-denominated Eurobonds.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Eurobonds are usually unsecured bonds underwritten by a consortium of financial institutions known as a `syndicate`. \n",
    "- Most Eurobonds are `bearer bonds` – only the clearing system knows who owns the bonds. \n",
    "- Global bonds are simultaneously issued in the Eurobond market and at least one domestic market.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tax Considerations\n",
    "The income portion of a bond investment is taxed at the `ordinary income tax rate`. However, some securities are `tax exempt`. \n",
    "- Capital gains and losses are treated differently than ordinary income. \n",
    "- Some countries differentiate between long-term and short-term gains. \n",
    "- `Original issue discounts` (for bonds issued at a discount) may include a portion of the accrued interest as interest income. \n",
    "$$original\\ issue\\ discount= par\\ value\\- original\\ issue\\ price$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(The purpose of an original issue discount tax provision is to tax investors in Company B’s bonds the same way as investors in Company A’s bonds.)"

    "## Structure of a Bond's Cash Flows\n",
    "### Principal Repayment Structures\n",
    "#### Bullet, Fully Amortized, and Partially Amortized Bonds\n",
    "1. `Bullet bonds` (a.k.a. `plain vanilla bond`, is the most common type) repay the entire principal at maturity. Periodic coupon payments for interest are made prior to maturity.\n",
    "2. A `fully amortized bond` are structured to provide equal annuity-like payments that are split between interest and principal. Over time, the interest portion decreases and the principal portion increases.\n",
    "3. A `partially amortized bond` amortizes some principal in each of its periodic payments and makes a final balloon payment that includes any principal that has not already been amortized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sinking Fund Arrangements\n",
    "1. `Sinking funds` can also be used to periodically retire the bond principal. The schedule usually specifies a percentage of a bond issue that must be retired each year. The trustee could choose which bonds to redeem randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Typically, the issuer will forward repayment proceeds to the bond’s trustee. The trustee will then either redeem bonds to this value or select by lottery the serial numbers of bonds to be paid off.*\n",
    "2. `Call provisions` can also be used that allow the issuer to retire some percentage of the bonds early. The actual bonds within the issue to be repurchased are selected at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The issuer can usually repurchase the bonds at the market price, at par, or at a specified sinking fund price, whichever is the lowest.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Sinking fund provisions reduce credit risk for investors by reducing the risk associated with a single balloon payment. However, reinvestment risk increased because the amortized principal that is received before maturity may be reinvested at low yields.\n",
    "### Coupon Payment Structures\n",
    "Coupons are the interest payments made to the bondholders. Most sovereign and corporate bonds pay coupons semi-annually (twice a year). Eurobonds typically pay coupons annually. While most bonds pay fixed-rate coupons, there are many variations.\n",
    "#### Floating-Rate Notes (FRNs)\n",
    "Bonds with coupon rates linked to an external index are called floating-rate notes. Government-sponsored enterprises often issue FRNs. Most FRNs pay **quarterly** coupons and pay a fixed spread over the reference rate (e.g., Libor + 1.5%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some FRNs, called `variable-rate notes`, have variable spreads. FRNs have virtually no interest rate risk because the coupon payments will increase when rates rise. Many FRNs have caps and floors to limit interest rate payments. `Inverse floaters` have coupon rates that move inversely with the reference rate.\n",
    "#### Step-Up Coupon Bonds\n",
    "Step-up coupon bonds pay coupons that increase periodically based on a set schedule. They offer investors protection against rising interest rates and give issuers an incentive to repurchase (call) bonds if interest rates remain stable or fall.\n",
    "#### Credit-Linked Coupon Bonds\n",
    "Bonds that have coupon rates tied to credit ratings are called credit-linked coupon bonds. The coupon rate will increase if the issuer gets downgraded and decrease if the issuer gets upgraded.\n",
    "#### Payment-in-Kind (PIK) Coupon Bonds\n",
    "PIK coupon bonds allow the issuer to pay coupons with more bonds rather than cash. Lenders expect higher yields on the bonds because borrowers increase their credit risk by issuing more bonds as in-kind coupon payments.\n",
    "#### Deferred Coupon Bonds\n",
    "Deferred coupon bonds, also called `split coupon bonds`, pay no coupons in the early years and then higher coupons in later years. This structure allows issuers to defer cash payments while investors can potentially defer their tax liability. `Zero-coupon bonds` are an extreme example of the deferred coupon structure.\n",
    "#### Index-Linked Bonds\n",
    "Indexed-linked bonds have the coupons tied to a specific index. While any index can be used, inflation-type indices are common. Governments are the major issuers of inflation-linked bonds. The effect of inflation may be reflected in changes to the coupons or principal.\n",
    "- Zero-coupon indexed bonds and have their principal adjusted.\n",
    "- Interest-indexed bonds have their coupons adjusted.\n",
    "- Capital-indexed bonds pay a fixed coupon rate that is applied to a principal amount that is adjusted for inflation.\n",
    "- Indexed-annuity bonds are amortizing bonds with annuity payments that are adjusted for inflation."

    "## Bonds with Contingency Provisions\n",
    "A bond's indenture may contain contingency provisions that specify actions that may be taken under certain conditions. Provisions that may be embedded in bonds include call options, put options, and conversion options.\n",
    "### Callable Bonds\n",
    "Issuers want to borrow at the lowest possible rate. If a company issues a 10-year, 5% coupon bond, and investors subsequently only require a 4% yield, the company will be paying an above-market rate on its borrowed funds. If the bonds included a call option, the company could repurchase its outstanding debt and issue new debt at a lower interest rate. If the market yield rises above 5%, the company can simply choose not the exercise its call option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, features that benefit borrowers generally do not benefit lenders. In the above scenario, the lenders would be forced to sell bonds that are paying 5% coupons at a time when the market has determined that a 4% yield is sufficient for that level of risk. To make matters worse, these investors would be forced to reinvest the funds from the called bonds in a low-yield environment. As compensation for this possibility, investors require issuers to pay higher coupon rates or charge a lower price on callable bonds compared to otherwise equivalent option-free bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "When interest rates fall, the price of the embedded call option increases. *The price of a callable bond equals the price of an option-free bond minus the price of the embedded call option*. The price of the callable bond will not increase as much as an option-free bond because the price of the call option is increasing. **As interest rates fall, the bond is more likely to be called, limiting the upside price increase potential.** \\[?\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Callable bonds often specify a `call protection period` during which the issuer is not permitted to exercise its call option. After the call protection period has expired, the issuer has the right to repurchase the bonds at a call price schedule that is outlined in the indenture.\n",
    "\n",
    "*For example, a 10-year callable bond may have a 5-year call protection period, at which point the issuer can repurchase it for a call price of 103 per 100 of par value. The call price may drop to 102 after 6 years, 101 after 7 years, and remain at 100 from the end of Year 8 until maturity.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Call options differ with respect to how much flexibility issuers have.\n",
    "- American-style call options can be exercised any time after the call protection period (if applicable) has expired. This structure is most valuable for issuers of callable bonds.\n",
    "- European-style call options can only be exercised on one specific call date. This structure is most restrictive for issuers.\n",
    "- Bermuda-style call options are more flexible than European-style options because they offer multiple call dates (e.g., every coupon payment date after the call protection period).\n",
    "\n",
    "Callable bonds may include a `make-whole provision` that compensates lenders with a lump-sum payment based on the present value of coupon payments that will not be received after if the call option is exercised. If borrowers offer such a provision, lenders will be willing to accept a lower call premium.\n",
    "### Putable Bonds\n",
    "Embedded put options give lenders the right to sell their bonds back to the issuer at a specified price (usually par) on set dates. Typically, put provisions are in effect for one- to five-year periods. A Bermuda-style put option gives investors multiple opportunities to sell their bonds back, while a European-style put option provides just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bondholders benefit from the opportunity to redeem their bonds if market rates rise or if the issuer's credit quality declines. In exchange for this protection, investors are willing to accept lower yields or pay a higher price on putable bonds compared to otherwise equivalent option-free bonds.\n",
    "### Convertible Bonds\n",
    "Convertible bonds grant lenders the right to convert their bonds into a specified number of the issuer's common shares. Bondholders will exercise this option when the issuer's stock does well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A convertible bond is effectively an option-free bond plus an equity call option**. Investors are willing to accept lower yields because they enjoy both the `upside potential of equity` and the `downside protection of a fixed-income security`. For their part, issuers benefit from lower borrowing costs and the elimination of debt obligations when conversion options are exercised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of convertible bonds include:\n",
    "- **Conversion price**: The share price at which bonds can be converted.\n",
    "- **Conversion ratio**: The number of common shares that will be received for each convertible bond. It is calculated as: $\\frac{Par\\ value}{Conversion\\ price}$\n",
    "- **Conversion value**: The value if converted immediately. It is calculated as: $Current\\ share\\ price\\times Conversion\\ ratio$\n",
    "- **Conversion premium**: $= convertible\\ bond’s\\ price - its\\ conversion$, `Conversion parity` exists if the conversion premium is zero. \n",
    "  1. If the convertible bond price is greater than the conversion value, there is a positive conversion premium and the conversion condition is described as `below parity`. \n",
    "  2. If the convertible bond price is less than the conversion value, the conversion premium is negative and the conversion condition is `above parity`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most investors do not exercise their conversion option until maturity, even if the issuer's share price has risen above the conversion price. This is because the interest payments on convertible bonds are generally higher than any dividend payments that would be made to common shareholders. In order to avoid such a scenario, issuers may retain a call option that grants them the right to force a conversion if their stock price rises above a specified level.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Warrants` is like a conversion option in the sense that they allow the holder to purchase common shares at a specific price. However, they are often offered as \"sweeteners\" to reduce borrowing costs rather than being structured as embedded options. Warrants may be traded separately on public equity exchanges. (A warrant is a separate, tradable security that entitles the holder to buy the underlying common share of the issuing company. )\n",
    "\n",
    "`Contingent convertible bonds (CoCos)` have been issued by financial institutions. The bonds automatically convert to equity if a certain trigger is reached (e.g., the issuer's capitalization ratio falls below the regulatory minimum level). Lenders have no control over the timing of exercise and they are exposed to downside risk, so yields are relatively high compared to otherwise equivalent bonds."

    "## Overview of Global Fixed-Income Markets\n",
    "### Classification of Fixed-Income Markets\n",
    "#### Type of Issuer\n",
    "The four broad categories of bond issuers are:\n",
    "1. Government and government-related\n",
    "2. Financial institutions\n",
    "3. Non-financial corporations\n",
    "4. Households\n",
    "\n",
    "Debt profiles vary by country, but mature markets tend to have higher debt/GDP ratios than emerging markets.\n",
    "#### Credit Quality\n",
    "Classification can be made based on scores from credit rating agencies. Broadly, they can be categorized as investment grade (ratings of Baa3 or above by Moody’s Investors Service or BBB– or above by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings) or non-investment grade (junk, speculative, high yield). Because some institutional investors are only permitted to hold investment-grade bonds, these securities tend to be more liquid than bonds that trade in the non-investment grade segment of the market.\n",
    "#### Maturity\n",
    "- Maturities up to one year are money market securities. These include government bills and corporate commercial paper. \n",
    "- Longer-dated debt issues are called capital market securities.\n",
    "#### Currency Denomination\n",
    "Emerging market issuers (both corporations and, to a lesser extent, governments) have found it easier to borrow by issuing bonds denominated in foreign currencies (e.g., USD, EUR). The price of a USD-denominated bond issued by a Mexican company will be primarily influenced by US interest rates and the company's credit quality.\n",
    "#### Type of Coupon\n",
    "Some bonds pay a fixed rate of interest while others pay a floating rate. To manage their interest rate exposure, banks that issue floating-rate debt tend to make floating-rate loans and invest in floating-rate securities. Corporations often issue floating-rate debt rather as an alternative to drawing on their lines of credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coupon payments for floating-rate bonds are set relative to a reference rate. Beginning in the 1980s, the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) has been the benchmark reference rate for maturities of up to one-year in multiple currencies. Libor is the rate at which London-based banks believe that they could borrow unsecured funds from other banks. At the peak of its popularity, there were 150 Libor rates (15 maturities for 10 different currencies).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference Rates**\n",
    "*Libor reflects the rate at which a panel of banks believe they could borrow unsecured funds from other banks in the London interbank money market for different currencies and different borrowing periods ranging from overnight to one year—the interbank money market, or interbank market, is the market of loans and deposits between banks for maturities up to one year.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Interbank offered rates are used as reference rates not only for floating-rate bonds, but also for other debt instruments including mortgages, derivatives such as interest rate and currency swaps, and many other financial contracts and products. *\n",

    "Problems with Libor emerged during the financial crisis of 2007-2009, when banks deliberately understated their borrowing costs to increase their perceived creditworthiness. Other banks manipulated their submissions to increase the value of their Libor-relative derivative positions. Since then, the administration of Libor has changed and market participants are preparing to adopt a secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) as a replacement. SOFR is based on transactions in the repo market.\n",

    "#### Geography\n",
    "Domestic bonds are issued in, denominated in, and sold in a particular country. Foreign bonds are issued by an issuer from another country. Eurobonds are issued outside the jurisdiction of any single country and may be denominated in any currency. Borrowers typically prefer to issue Eurobonds rather than foreign bonds because reporting and regulatory requirements are lower and the larger pool of potential investors reduces borrowing costs. Investors also distinguish between developed markets and emerging bond markets. Bonds that are issued in emerging markets tend to have different risks than developed market debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other\n",
    "Many other classification methods can be used, such as inflation-linked or tax-exempt status. For example, most municipal bonds issued in the United States are tax-exempt. Some countries choose to tax coupon income from government bonds, but not capital gains"

    "## Primary and Secondary Bond Markets\n",
    "### Primary Bond Markets\n",
    "Bonds are first sold to investors in the primary markets through `public offerings` and `private placements`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Public offerings are usually done via \n",
    "- underwritten offerings\n",
    "- best-effort offerings\n",
    "- auctions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Underwritten offerings** (also called `firm commitment offerings`) are underwritten by an investment bank. A bond issue that is underwritten by a group of investment banks is called a `syndicated offering`. The underwriting process includes the following six phases:\n",
    "1. The issuer determines the amount of funding needed and the type of bond offering.\n",
    "2. The issuer selects the underwriter, or the lead underwriter in the case of a syndicated offering. Underwriters buy bonds from the issuer and sell them to investors at a higher price, so offering prices are determined by negotiations between issuers and underwriters.\n",
    "3. The structure (such as terms, notional amount, coupon rate, price) is set, but may change before the pricing day. It is critical the price is not set too high or too low. The underwriter also completes the necessary regulatory forms.\n",
    "4. The underwriter must gauge the demand to help determine the final price. This could be done through advertisements, informal discussions, or trading in the `grey market`, which is an informal forward market for upcoming bond issues. Trading in the grey market provides underwriters with data that can be used to help set the price at which a new bond issue should be offered.\n",
    "5. The `pricing day` is the last day investors can commit to buying the bond. It is the day before the `offering day`, which is when the underwriter purchases the bond issue from the issuer.\n",
    "6. Bonds are delivered to investors about 14 days later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, in a **best effort offering**, the investment bank only serves as a broker. It only tries to sell the bond issue at the negotiated offering price if it is able to for a commission. Thus, the investment bank has less risk and correspondingly less incentive to sell the bonds in a best effort offering than in an underwritten offering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shelf registration** allows issuers to offer additional bonds without preparing a new offering circular. Because disclosure requirements are lower, only well-established issuers have access to shelf registration. Some jurisdictions limit sales of shelf offerings to qualified institutional investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Auctions** allow investors to bid on bonds, which helps to facilitate price discovery. **Most sovereign bonds are sold to investors through public auctions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*The United States uses a single-price auction process, which results in a single price for both competitive and non-competitive bidders. Other countries (e.g., Canada, Germany) use a multi-price auction process that can result in multiple different prices and coupon rates for the same bond issue. In a single-price bond auction, a bidder that enters a competitive bid specifies the rate (yield) that is considered acceptable. If the rate specified in the competitive bid is above the rate (yield) determined at auction, the investor will not be offered any securities.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Private placements** are usually unregistered bonds sold to a very small group of accredited investors. Trading in secondary markets is very limited, so liquidity is low. Investors in this market often have influence over the structure of the bonds.\n",
    "### Secondary Bond Markets (\"Aftermarket\")\n",
    "Bonds are traded among `institutional investors` and `central banks` in secondary markets. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Liquidity` refers to the ability to trade (buy or sell) securities quickly and easily at prices close to their fair market value.\n",
    "- Liquidity involves much more than “how quickly one can turn a bond into cash.” This statement implicitly assumes a long position, but some market participants need to buy quickly when covering a short position. \n",
    "- speed of trading alone does not constitute a liquid market. (In a liquid market, trading takes place quickly at prices close to the security’s fair market value.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structure\n",
    "Liquid securities can be bought and sold at prices close to fair value. Most trading of bonds is done in the `over-the-counter market` rather than on `organised exchanges`. \n",
    "1. An organized exchange provides a place where buyers and sellers can meet to arrange their trades. Although buy or sell orders may come from anywhere, the transaction must take place at the exchange according to the rules imposed by the exchange. \n",
    "2. With OTC markets, buy and sell orders initiated from various locations are matched through a communications network. OTC markets need electronic trading platforms over which users submit buy and sell orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "The level of commitment to the different sectors of the market varies among market makers. The `bid–offer spread` or `bid–ask spread`, which reflects the prices at which dealers will buy from a customer (bid) and sell to a customer (offer or ask), is very often used as an indicator of liquidity. A low bid-ask spread indicates a liquid market. Some illiquid issues have no quoted bid and ask prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Settlement** is the process that occurs after the trade is made. The bonds are passed to the buyer and payment is received by the seller. Government bonds usually settle on a T+1 basis (settlement takes place the day after the trade date), while corporate bonds usually settle on a T+2 or T+3 basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trades clear within either or both of the two main clearing systems:\n",
    "- Euroclear \n",
    "- Clearstream\n",
    "Settlement occurs by means of a simultaneous exchange of bonds for cash on the books of the clearing system. An electronic bridge connecting Euroclear and Clearstream allows transfer of bonds from one system to the other, so it is not necessary to have accounts at both systems. Both systems operate on a paperless, computerized book-entry basis, although a bond issue is still represented by a physical document, the `global note`."

    "## Government Debt\n",
    "### Sovereign Bonds\n",
    "#### Characteristics of Sovereign Bonds\n",
    "Sovereign bonds are issued by national governments to fund spending when tax revenues are insufficient. They are often classified according to their maturity. In the United States:\n",
    "- Treasury bills (T-bills) have maturities of less than one year\n",
    "- Treasury notes have maturities of 1 to 10 years\n",
    "- Treasury bonds have maturities of longer than 10 years\n",
    "\n",
    "The most recent version of a particular government bond is called an `on-the-run issue`. For example, if the US Treasury conducts a new auction of 1-year T-bills every month, the January issue will be considered on-the-run until the February auction is conducted, at which point the February issue is considered on-the-run and the January issue is referred to as `off-the-run`. In general, on-the-run issues are more liquid because securities typically trade less frequently as they age.\n",
    "\n",
    "**On-the-run government bonds serve as a benchmark for corporate bonds.** For example, if a newly-issued 5-year government bond has a 5% yield, an equivalent 5-year corporate bond with a 7% spread is described as trading at a 2% spread over the benchmark rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Money market securities, which have maturities of one year or less, are usually issued on a pure discount basis and redeemed at par. By contrast, capital market government securities typically make regular coupon payments (e.g., annually, semiannually).\n",
    "#### Credit Quality of Sovereign Bonds\n",
    "Sovereign bonds are usually issued with no collateral. Instead, they are backed by the national government's authority to raise revenues via taxation. Fiscal surpluses can be used to retire existing debt, while fiscal deficits are financed by issuing new debt and \"rolling over\" maturing debt issues. National governments have the unique ability to raise funds by printing more money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, excessive reliance on taxation can overburden an economy and threaten a government's ability to repay its debts. Additionally, printing more money will devalue a currency relative to others. While sovereign bonds are generally considered to be free of default risk, certain countries (notably the United States) had their credit rating downgraded in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "National governments may choose to issue foreign currency-denominated debt when investors are willing to accept credit risk but not foreign exchange risk. For example, the Swedish government enjoys the highest possible credit ratings but still chooses to issue USD-denominated debt because demand among investors for Swedish krona is comparatively low. Emerging-market governments often find it easier to borrow by issuing debt denominated in major currencies. However, countries are more limited in their ability to repay foreign currency obligations. Because a government can much more readily obtain more of its own currency than a currency issued by another sovereign government, credit rating agencies tend to give higher ratings to otherwise equivalent bonds denominated in the government's local currency. Bonds issued in the sovereign’s currency and a strong domestic savings base are both favorable sovereign rating factors.\n",
    "#### Types of Sovereign Bonds\n",
    "- `Fixed-Rate Bonds` \n",
    "Sovereign bonds most commonly issue fixed-rate bonds. Zero-coupon bonds can be thought of as bonds that pay 0% coupons. Most short-term government debt obligations (i.e., maturities of less than one year) are pure discount securities. Longer-term bonds are usually fixed-rate obligations.\n",
    "- `Floating-Rate Bonds` \n",
    "Some countries issue floating-rate bonds to attract investors who want to reduce their exposure to interest rate risk. However, the vast majority of sovereign debt issues are fixed-rate securities.\n",
    "- `Inflation-Linked Bonds` (a.k.a `linkers`)\n",
    "Investors concerned about inflation risk prefer inflation-linked bonds. Adjustments are made to a bond's coupons and/or principal based on changes in the level of a specified price index. In the US, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are linked to the Consumer Price Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Consols` are bonds with no maturity (i.e., they are perpetuities)"

    "### Non-Sovereign Bonds \n",
    "Non-sovereign bonds are issued by `sub-national governments`, such as states and cities. They are often used to finance specific projects like schools or roads. They are referred to as `municipal bonds` in the United States. Non-sovereign governments can raise funds to service their debt obligations by taxing citizens who fall under their jurisdiction or by accessing a stream of cash flows from a project that was financed with debt. Although historical default rates are relatively low for these bonds, they carry greater credit risk than equivalent sovereign bonds and investors require higher yields as compensation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-sovereign bonds usually trade at a higher yield and lower price than sovereign bonds with similar characteristics. The higher yield is because of the higher credit risk associated with non-sovereign issuers relative to sovereign issuers, although default rates of local governments are historically low and their credit quality is usually high. The higher yield may also be a consequence of non-sovereign bonds being less liquid than sovereign bonds with similar characteristics.\n",
    "### Quasi-Government Bonds (Agency Bonds)\n",
    "Quasi-government agencies perform government functions but they are not true government entities. In the United States, such agencies include government-sponsored entities (e.g., Federal National Mortgage Association). Although most agency bonds do not carry an explicit government guarantee, investors often price them based on the assumption of an implicit guarantee. Quasi-government bonds generally enjoy high credit ratings due to historically low default rates in this sector.\n",
    "### Supranational Bonds\n",
    "Multilateral agencies like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund also issue bonds. Usually, these are plain vanilla bonds, although floating-rate notes and callable bonds are occasionally issued. "

    "## Corporate Debt\n",
    "### Bank Loans, Syndicated Loans\n",
    "`Bilateral loans` (i.e., single lender to single borrower) are often made by banks to small and medium-sized companies. Syndicated loans are made by a group of lenders to a single borrower. This allows lenders to diversify credit risk. Some syndicated loans are securitized and marketed to investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both bilateral and syndicated loans are usually structured with floating rate interest payments that are determined by a reference rate and a spread to reflect the borrower's credit risk. For example, a large company may pay Libor + 2.0% while a smaller company pays Libor + 2.5%. The \"prime rate\" that banks offer to their most creditworthy clients tends to fluctuate with the rate at which banks can borrow from each other in the overnight market.\n",
    "### Commercial Paper\n",
    "#### Characteristics of Commercial Paper\n",
    "Companies issue commercial paper (CP) in the public market or through a private placement as a *low-cost source of short-term financing*. Corporations, governments, and supranational agencies all use commercial paper, but **financial institutions are the largest issuers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial paper obligations are unsecured promissory notes with maturities of less than *three months* on average, but they may be up to one year or as short as overnight. Maturing obligations can be rolled over by issuing new commercial paper. This can be a valuable source of `bridge financing` when borrowers would prefer to wait before issuing long-term debt.\n",
    "#### Credit Quality of Commercial Paper\n",
    "Historical default rates on commercial paper are very low, largely because this source of funding has traditionally been available to only the largest corporations. Over time, investors have become increasingly willing to hold the commercial paper of less creditworthy issuers if they are sufficiently compensated with higher yields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because commercial paper obligations are `unsecured`, credit rating agencies typically require borrowers to have sufficient `backup lines of credit` to cover 100% of their obligations. This acts as a safeguard against rollover risk as it gives investors assurance that issuers will be able to repurchase their outstanding commercial paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial paper is attractive to investors with short horizons and a low tolerance for credit risk (e.g., corporate treasury departments, money market mutual funds). Because investors generally hold these short-term securities until maturity, relatively little commercial paper is traded in the secondary market. Yields on corporate commercial paper are higher than those on comparable government securities to reflect greater credit risk exposure and lower market liquidity.\n",
    "#### US Commercial Paper vs. Eurocommercial Paper\n",
    "Many countries have active markets for domestic commercial paper. Of these, the `United States commercial paper (USCP) market` is the largest. The international market for commercial paper is called the `Eurocommercial paper (ECP) market`. In general, ECP transaction sizes are smaller and market liquidity is lower compared to the USCP market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key differences between the USCP and ECP markets are summarized in the table below. Commercial paper, whether US commercial paper or Eurocommercial paper, is negotiable—that is, investors can buy and sell commercial paper on secondary markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Corporate Notes and Bonds\n",
    "#### Maturities\n",
    "Most bonds have maturities between 1 and 30 years, but maturities of 40, 50, or even 100 years are not uncommon. While there is no universal classification system, bonds are often placed in the following maturity categories:\n",
    "- Short-term: Five years or less\n",
    "- Intermediate-term: Longer than 5 years, up to 12 years\n",
    "- Long-term: 12 years or longer\n",
    "- Medium-term notes (`MTNs`) have traditionally been used by companies to bridge the funding gap between commercial paper and long-term bonds. However, MTNs can have maturities as long as 100 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinguishing feature of MTNs is that companies can offer them continuously to investors through an agent (dealer) in a range of maturities. This gives the issuer more flexibility in raising funds compared to bonds and lets investors *customize* their purchases to match their specific cash flow needs. The MTN market can be broken into three segments: \n",
    "- short-term securities that carry floating or fixed rates, \n",
    "- medium- to long-term securities that primarily bear a fixed rate of interest, and \n",
    "- structured notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yields on MTNs are higher compared to equivalent publicly issued bonds due to their relative liquidity**. However, MTNs may still be a lower-cost source of financing for issuers due to lower registration and underwriting costs.\n",
    "#### Coupon Payment Structures\n",
    "Coupons take on a variety of formats, including \n",
    "- fixed, \n",
    "- floating, \n",
    "- linked to inflation or credit risk, \n",
    "- deferred, or \n",
    "- `payment-in-kind` (PIK coupon bonds make periodic coupon payments, but not necessarily in cash; the issuer may pay interest in the form of securities, such as bonds or common shares.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Payment frequencies range from monthly to annual.\n",
    "#### Principal Repayment Structures\n",
    "Maturity structures can be `serial` or `term`. Investors can choose their preferred maturity.\n",
    "- A bond with a term maturity structure repays its *entire* face value at maturity. \n",
    "- A serial maturity structure reduces credit risk by having a certain amount of bonds within an issue mature. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Sinking fund arrangements` can also be used to reduce credit risk by requiring the borrower to repurchase a certain percentage of the issue each year. The bonds to be retired are selected at random. Adding a sinking fund arrangement to a term maturity structure effectively creates a serial maturity structure, except that investors do not know in advance which bonds will be retired.\n",
    "#### Asset or Collateral Backing\n",
    "Collateral, including physical and financial assets, can be pledged to reduce credit risk. Secured lenders have a claim to specific assets. By contrast, unsecured creditors typically experience greater losses in the event of a bankruptcy.\n",
    "#### Contingency Provisions\n",
    "Contingency provisions like calls, puts, and conversions are common. The call provision benefits the issuer, while the put and conversion provisions benefit the investor.\n",
    "#### Issuance, Trading, and Settlement\n",
    "Issuance and settling procedures for bonds are consistent worldwide. New corporate bond issues are initially sold by underwriters in the primary market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondary bond market trading is largely done OTC through dealers who carry inventories and \"make a market\" by being willing to take either side of a trade. Dealers quote bid and ask prices in basis point terms and profit from the spread. Settlement usually occurs faster in the secondary market compared to the primary market."

    "Structured financial instruments represent a broad sector of financial instruments. This sector includes \n",
    "- asset-backed securities (ABS) and \n",
    "- collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). \n",
    "\n",
    "CDOs are securities backed by a diversified pool of one or more debt obligations. The structured financial instruments covered in this section are structured financial instruments apart from ABS and CDOs. These instruments typically have customized structures that often combine a bond and at least one derivative. **A structured instrument's coupons and/or redemption value are linked to the performance of the underlying asset(s).** The use of `derivatives` gives the holder of the structured financial instrument exposure to one or more underlying assets, such as equities, bonds, and commodities.\n",
    "### Capital Protected Instruments\n",
    "A `guarantee certificate` combines a zero-coupon bond with a call option. Consider the example of a 1-year zero-coupon bond yielding 4.17\\%. An investor purchases this bond today for 960 and receives \\\\$1,000 in one year. With a guarantee certificate, the investor pays \\\\$1,000 today for a package that includes the zero-coupon bond that is currently worth \\\\$960 and a \\\\$40 call option on an underlying asset.\n",

    "For the investor, the worse outcome is to receive \\\\$1,000 in one year and have the call option expire worthless. However, the upside potential is unlimited if the price of the underlying asset rises above the call price.

    "A `credit-linked note (CLN)` is a type of insurance contract between a party buying credit protection and a credit protection seller. The CLN buyer effectively borrows from the seller, receiving an up-front payment, and agreeing to pay coupons and return the principal at maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of a CLN is contingent upon a specific event, such as a default on an underlying bond. If that event does not occur, the credit protection seller will receive regular coupon payments and the full repayment of their principal. If the event does occur, the credit protection seller is only required to repay the difference between the par value of the CLN and the nominal value of the reference asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLNs effectively transfer specific credit risks to those willing to bear them. These are attractive investments for those willing to accept credit risk because they pay relatively high coupons (i.e., yield enhancement) and can usually be purchased at a discount to par, allowing for potential capital gains.\n",
    "### Participation Instruments\n",
    "Participation instruments pay coupons based on the performance of an underlying asset. Floating-rate notes are participation instruments with a reference rate as their underlying asset. Fixed-income investors seeking equity market exposure can purchase a participation instrument linked to an equity index. These instruments typically do not offer capital protection.\n",
    "### Leveraged Instruments\n",
    "Leveraged instruments are structured financial instruments created to magnify returns and offer the possibility of high payoffs from small investments. `Leverage inverse floaters` pay higher coupons when the underlying reference rate decreases (and vice versa). The coupon rate for an inverse floater is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Inverse\\ floater\\ coupon\\ rate=Maxiumum\\ coupon\\ rate−(Leverage\\times Reference\\ rate)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example of a leveraged inverse floater with 2× leverage and a maximum rate of 10\\%, which is what the coupon rate would be if the reference rate fell to zero. If the reference rate is 3\\%, the inverse floater's coupon rate will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$10\\%−(2×3\\%)=4\\%$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the reference rate falls to 2\\%, the inverse floater's coupon rate will increase to 6\\%. Conversely, the coupon rate will fall to 2\\% if the reference rate increases to 4\\%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"pure\" inverse floater` has 1× leverage, meaning that a 1\\% increase in the reference rate will cause a 1\\% decrease in the coupon rate (and vice versa). \n",
    "- `deleveraged inverse floater` has leverage between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse floaters often have a floor that specifies a `minimum coupon rate`; for example, a floor may be set at zero to avoid the possibility of a negative interest rate. \n",
    "### Short-Term Funding Alternatives Available to Banks\n",
    "#### Retail Deposits\n",
    "Retail deposits are a primary source of funding for many banks. This includes demand deposits and savings accounts. However, often banks originate more loans than they can fund with retail deposits.\n",
    "#### Short-Term Wholesale Funds\n",
    "Wholesale funds can come from central banks, interbank funds, and certificates of deposit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many central banks require deposits from its member banks to ensure sufficient liquidity. Central banks allow borrowing for short-term funding needs. Banks with surplus funds at the central bank are allowed to loan to banks with deficit reserves at the central bank funds rate, which is called the Fed funds rate in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interbank loans and deposits are made between banks. The term ranges from one day to one year. Since it is unsecured, it relies on the confidence in the banking sector, which can be shaky in times of economic turmoil.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certificates of deposit (CDs) have specified maturity and interest rate. They can be negotiable or non-negotiable. If a certificate of deposit is non-negotiable, investors are not allowed to sell the certificate. They will also pay a withdrawal penalty to access the money early. Negotiable CDs allow investors to sell the certificate on the open market prior to maturity. Large-denomination negotiable CDs are an important source of wholesale funds. Most have maturities less than one year.\n",
    "#### Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements\n",
    "A repo is an agreement to sell securities and repurchase them later at a higher price. It is effectively a collateralized loan. Repos are needed for active bond markets. It is referred to as a reverse repurchase agreement from the perspective of the lending party.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repo agreement terms vary. A one-day term is called an overnight repo. Government securities dealers use repos to fund purchases of new issues and central banks use repos as part of their open market operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interest rate on a repurchase agreement is called the repo rate. It is paid on the repurchase date. The repo rate is affected by the following factors:\n",
    "- Collateral risk: Repo rates increase with the level of credit risk in the collateral.\n",
    "- Term: Repo rates increase with the term.\n",
    "- Delivery requirements: Repo rates are lower when delivery to the lender is required.\n",
    "- Supply and demand conditions of the collateral: Repo rates are lower when the collateral used is in high demand.\n",
    "- Interest rates of alternative financing: Repo rates are lower if alternative financing rates are low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit risk is still present even if the collateral is of high quality. The dealer could default and not repurchase the collateral when it has dropped in value. The lender of funds is most vulnerable. The repo margin, or haircut, is the difference between the collateral market value and loan value. The margin is affected by the agreement length, collateral quality, credit quality of counterparty, and supply and demand conditions."
