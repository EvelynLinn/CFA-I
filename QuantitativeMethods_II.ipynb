    "# Common Probability Distributions\n",
    "A probability distribution specifies the probabilities of the possible outcomes of a random variable. Examples of random variables:\n",

    "- earnings per share \n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases examples:\n",
    "- the Black–Scholes–Merton option pricing model\n",
    "- the binomial option pricing model (price up or price down)\n",
    "- the capital asset pricing model\n",

    "We can view a probability distribution in two ways:\n",
    "#### Probability Function\n",
    "$P(X = x)$ is the probability that a random variable $X$ takes on the value $x$. (Note that capital X represents the random variable and lowercase $x$ represents a specific value that the random variable may take.) \n",
    "- For a discrete random variable, the shorthand notation for the probability function is $p(x) = P(X = x)$. \n",
    "- For continuous random variables, the probability function is denoted $f(x)$ and called the probability density function (pdf), or just the density.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cumulative Distribution Function (cdf)\n",
    "It gives the probability that a random variable X is less than or equal to a particular value x, P(X ≤ x). For both discrete and continuous random variables, the shorthand notation is $F(x) = P(X ≤ x).$ \n",

    "### The Normal Distribution \n",
    "The normal distribution is popular for quantitative work. This is partly because of the `central limit theorem` – the sum of a large number of independent random variables is approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics**: \n",
    "- The normal distribution can be completely described by two parameters – mean ($μ$) and variance ($σ^2$). Defined as $X∼N(μ,σ^2)$ *(read “X follows a normal distribution with mean $μ$ and variance $σ^2$”)*. \n",
    "- It is symmetric (skewness = 0) and has a **kurtosis of 3**. \n",
    "- The mean, median, and mode are all the same. \n",
    "- Also, a linear combination of two or more normal random variables is (also) normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multivariate Distribution\n",
    "A multivariate normal distribution for the returns on $n$ stocks is completely defined by three lists of parameters:\n",
    "- the list of the mean returns on the individual securities (n means in total);\n",
    "- the list of the securities’ variances of return (n variances in total); and\n",
    "- the list of all the distinct pairwise return correlations: n(n − 1)/2 distinct correlations in total.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In order to specify the normal distribution for portfolio return, we need the means, variances, and the distinct pairwise correlations of the component securities.**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x)=\\frac{1}{σ\\sqrt{2π}}exp\\big(\\frac{−(x−μ)^2}{2σ^2}\\big)\\ \\ \\  for−∞<x<+∞$$\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: right\"> Equation 3 </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal density with $μ = 0$ and $σ = 1$ is called the `standard normal distribution` (or `unit normal distribution`). \n",
    "##### Normal Distribution as an Approximate Model for Returns\n",
    "The normal distribution is used to model many security returns. However, the fit is not good for distributions with fat tails (i.e., high kurtosis) or asymmetry. \n",
    "- The normal distribution is a closer fit for quarterly and yearly holding period returns on a diversified equity portfolio than it is for daily or weekly returns.\n",
    "- Normal distribution tends to underestimate the probability of extreme returns. (Since actual return distribution is more fat-tailed).\n",
    "- Option returns are skewed. Cautious in using the normal distribution to model the returns on portfolios containing **significant positions in options**.\n",
    "- The normal distribution is not appropriate for asset prices with a `floor` of zero, even though it is a reasonable fit for asset returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having established that the normal distribution is the appropriate model for a variable of interest, we can use it to make the following probability statements:\n",
    "- Approx. 50\\% of all observations fall in the interval μ ± (2/3)σ.\n",
    "- Approx. 68% of all observations fall in the interval μ ± σ.\n",
    "- Approx. 95% of all observations fall in the interval μ ± 2σ.\n",
    "- Approx. 99% of all observations fall in the interval μ ± 3σ.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, the population mean and standard deviation must be estimated from samples. This creates an unlimited number of normal distributions.\n",
    "#### Standardizing a Random Variable\n",
    "It is often useful to standardize the normal random variable $X$ by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This results in a `standard normal random variable` $Z$ that is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have $X$ ~ $N(μ,σ^2)$ (read “$X$ follows the normal distribution with parameters $μ$ and $σ^2$”), we standardize it using the formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z = \\frac{(X – μ)}{σ}$$\n",
