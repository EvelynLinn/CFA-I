    "Statistics can refer to both data and method. Statistical methods include the following:\n",
    "- Descriptive Statistics: Turn data into information by summarizing\n",
    "- Statistical Inference (`inferencial`): Make forecasts based on probability theory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Populations and Samples\n",
    "A `population` is all members of a specified group. `Parameters` are descriptive measures of the population:\n",
    "- size: $N$\n",
    "- mean: $\\mu$\n",
    "- std: $\\sigma$\n",
    "- variance: $\\sigma^2$\n",
    "- proportion: $p$\n",
    "\n",
    "A `sample` is a subset of the population. A process of sampling is used to try and make the sample representative of the population. A sample statistic is a descriptive measure of a sample.\n",
    "- size: $n$\n",
    "- mean: $\\bar{X}$\n",
    "- std: $S$\n",
    "- variance: $S^2$\n",
    "- proportion: $\\hat{p}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measurement Scales\n",
    "- `Nominal scales` are used to categorize but not rank data. An example is the style of a mutual fund (small-cap vs. large-cap). The scale categorizes the funds based on their investment strategies but does not rank them.\n",
    "- With `ordinal scales`, data is sorted into categories and ordered based on some characteristic. An example includes Morningstar star ratings for mutual funds.\n",
    "- `Interval scales` provide ranking and ensure the difference between scale values are equal. An example is the Celsius temperature scale. There are no true zero points, so ratios are meaningless.\n",
    "- `Ratio scales` are like an interval scale, but with a true zero point. This allows ratios to be meaningful. An example is money measurement."

    "## Frequency Distribution and Graphic Presentation of Data\n",
    "#### The Frequency Distribution\n",
    "A `frequency distribution summarizes` the data into a few intervals, which is helpful when working with large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "When constructing a frequency distribution\n",
    "1. first sort the data and calculate the `range` (maximum value – minimum value). \n",
    "2. Determine the desired `number of intervals`, $k$, which makes the width of each interval equal to $\\frac{range}{k}$. \n",
    "3. Then, construct a table that shows the number of observations in each interval, which is the absolute frequency. Each observation will only fall in one interval since the intervals will not overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above approach can be modified to make the intervals stop and start at rounded numbers (e.g., whole numbers). The choice of $k$ is somewhat arbitrary but should be chosen to best summarize the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `relative frequency` is $\\frac{absolute\\ frequency}{total\\ number\\ of\\ observations}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The `cumulative relative frequency` adds up the relative frequencies as you move from the first to the last interval. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `frequency distribution` illustrates where most of the data lie and shows the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "#### The Histogram\n",
    "A histogram uses the data from a frequency distribution to create a bar chart.  The height of each bar represents the frequency. If no observations were in a particular interval, the bar height would be zero.\n",
    "#### The Frequency Polygon and the Cumulative Frequency Distribution\n",
    "A `frequency polygon` plots each interval's midpoint on the x-axis and the absolute frequency on the y-axis. The points are connected with `line segments`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A line graph can also be used to illustrate the cumulative frequency distribution. This shows how many observations lie below a certain value. Most observations will lie on the steep slope."

    "## Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "A measure of central tendency indicates where the data is centered. These are the most common statistical measures. The most common central tendency measures are arithmetic mean, median, mode, weighted mean, and geometric mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Arithmetic Mean\n",
    "The `arithmetic mean` is the most common measure of where the data are centered. It is the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations. Both population means and sample means can be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `population mean` is the arithmetic mean for the entire population. All observations are included in calculating this parameter. For a population with $N$ members, the population mean is: \n",
    "$$μ=\\frac{\\sum^N_{i=1}{X_i}}{N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sample mean` or average is the arithmetic mean for a sample. For a sample with n observations, the sample mean is:\n",
    "$$\\bar{X}=\\frac{\\sum^n_{i=1}{X_i}}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "`Cross-sectional data` are observations that capture characteristics of different units at a specific point in time. For example, the average dividend yield among FTSE 100 companies is a cross-sectional mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Time-series data` are observations of the same unit at different points in time. For example, the average month-end dividend yield for the FTSE 100 over the past 10 years is a time-series mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The arithmetic mean is like the center of gravity for an object. The sum of the deviations from the mean is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^n{(X_i−\\bar{X})}=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the mean can be skewed by extreme values, or `outliers`. For example, the mean of 3, 8, 9, 10, and 100 is 26. One method of addressing outliers is to use a trimmed mean, which is calculated by discarding a certain percentage of the highest and lowest values. For example, with a sample of 100 observations, a 2% trimmed mean would be the arithmetic mean without the highest value and the lowest value. With a Winsorized mean, no observations are excluded from the calculation, but any outliers' values are adjusted to either an upper or lower limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is easy to work with and uses all the information about the observations' size and magnitude. Since the mean is sensitive to extreme values, it can be misleading.\n",
    "### Weighted Mean\n",
    "A portfolio’s return is a weighted mean return computed from the returns on the individual assets, where the weight applied to each asset’s return is the fraction of the portfolio invested in that asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weighted mean formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{X_w}=\\sum_{i=1}^n{w_iX_i}$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$w_i$ is the weight\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum^n_{i=1}{w_i=1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weights less than zero are permissible, which would represent a `short asset` in a portfolio.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighted averages are used to calculate past portfolio or index returns. They can also be used to calculate future expected returns by weighing various scenarios.\n",
    "### The Geometric Mean\n",
    "The geometric mean is used to average rates over time or compute growth rates. It is often used to average portfolio returns from different time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "G = \\sqrt[n]{x_{1}x_{2}...x_{n}} = \\sqrt[n]{∏_{i=1}^n{X_i}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}with $X_{i}≥0$ for i=1,2,…,n.\n",
    "\n",
    "One must be added to each return when calculating the geometric mean. For T holding period returns, the geometric mean return is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_G=\\sqrt[T]{∏_{t=1}^T{(1+R_t)}}−1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometric mean is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean. The two are equal when all observations have the same value. Greater dispersion in the values of observations will increase the difference between the geometric and arithmetic means.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The geometric mean return represents an investment's compound growth rate over multiple periods. By contrast, the arithmetic mean is used to measure performance for a single period.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Harmonic Mean\n",
    "The harmonic mean is not as commonly used but is appropriate for some circumstances. It is the reciprocal of the average of the reciprocals, which is calculated as follows:\n",
    "$$\\bar{X_H}=\\frac{1}{\\Big(\\frac{1}{n}\\Big)\\Big(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^n{\\frac{1}{X_i}}\\Big)}$$\n",
    "where $X_i>0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The observation's weight is inversely proportional to its magnitude. This would be appropriate if you want the average price paid for a security when investing the same dollar amount for several time periods (also known as the `cost averaging technique`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The harmonic mean is always less than the geometric mean (which is less than the arithmetic mean) unless all the observations are the same.\n",
    "### The Median\n",
    "The median is the middle item of a sorted list. Assume there are $n$ items:\n",
    "- If $n$ is odd, then the median is the $(\\frac{n+1}{2})$th term.\n",
    "- If $n$ is even, then the median is the mean of the $(\\frac{n}{2})$th and $(\\frac{n+2}{2})$th terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is not sensitive to extreme values because it focuses only on the position, not the magnitude. The median is more complicated to calculate (less mathematically tractable) than the mean.\n",
    "### The Mode\n",
    "The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a distribution. Some distributions have more than one mode, while others have none. A distribution with just one mode is called unimodal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data grouped in intervals have modal intervals. This is the highest bar in a histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode is the only measure of central tendency that can be used with nominal data."

    "If we arrange the observations in ascending order, then the quantile is a value at or below which a stated fraction of the data is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many common quantiles used in practice. Distributions are often divided into four quartiles, five quintiles, ten deciles, or one hundred percentiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $y_{th}$ percentile is the value at or below which $y$ percent of the observations lie. \n",
    "\n",
    "The values of quartiles, quintiles, and deciles are based on percentiles. For example, the 90th percentile is equal to the ninth decile, and the 50th percentile is equal to the second quartile. Note that the 50th percentile is also the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "The location of the $y_{th}$ percentile ($L_y$) in a list of n observations ranked in ascending order (lowest to highest) is calculated as follows:\n",

For example, analysts often refer to the set of companies with returns falling below the 10th percentile cutoff point as the bottom return decile. Dividing data into quantiles based on some characteristic allows analysts to evaluate the impact of that characteristic on a quantity of interest. For instance, empirical finance studies commonly rank companies based on the market value of their equity and then sort them into deciles. The 1st decile contains the portfolio of those companies with the smallest market values, and the 10th decile contains those companies with the largest market value. Ranking companies by decile allows analysts to compare the performance of small companies with large ones."

    "An asymmetrical distribution is skewed. \n",
    "- A `positively skewed` distribution (`long right tail`) has frequent small losses and a few extreme gains. The mode is less than the median, which is less than the mean.\n",
    "- A `negatively skewed` distribution (`long left tail`) has frequent small gains and a few extreme losses. The mean is less than the median, which is less than the mode. Investors should be concerned if returns have this distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Investors should be attracted by a POSITIVE skew (distribution skewed to the right) because the mean return falls above the median. Relative to the mean return, positive skew amounts to a limited, though frequent, downside compared with a somewhat unlimited, but less frequent, upside.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness is the average cubed deviation from the mean divided by the cubed standard deviation. The formula for sample skewness is given in the curriculum, but it is unlikely that you will be asked to use it on the exam. It is far more likely that you will be given a skewness measure and asked to interpret it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the value of the skewness measure is greater than zero, the distribution is positively skewed. A negative skewness measure indicates a negatively skewed distribution. As a general rule, skewness measures are considered significant if their magnitude exceeds ±0.5."

    "## Using Geometric and Arithmetic Means\n",
    "Geometric means are preferred when reporting historical returns over **multiple periods**. This corresponds to what would have to be earned each year to match the cumulative returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The arithmetic mean should be used to estimate the return over a **one-period horizon**. It is also better for estimating a forward-looking equity risk premium. The arithmetic mean is also better for predicting ending wealth, so it should be used for discounting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometric mean is approximately the arithmetic mean minus half the variance. We can express this relationship mathematically as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R_G≈R_A−\\frac{σ^2}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As implied by the above formula, the difference between the geometric and arithmetic means increases with higher volatility levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "A semilogarithmic scale plots an arithmetic scale for time on the horizontal axis and a logarithmic scale for value on the vertical axis. On a logarithmic scale, 10-fold increases are equally spaced. So, the increase along the vertical axis is the same for a \\\\$9 increase in value from $1 to \\\\$10 as it is for a $90 increase from \\\\$10 to \\\\$100. Graphically, a constant growth rate would be shown as a linear increase on a semilogarithmic scale rather than the exponentially upward sloping increase that would appear if both axes were plotted on arithmetic scales."

    "# Probability Concepts\n",
    "## Probability\n",
    "The return on a risky asset is a random variable because the outcomes (possible values) are uncertain. An `event` is a specified set of outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three approaches are used to estimate probabilities:\n",
    "- `Subjective probabilities` are based on personal judgment.\n",
    "- `Empirical probabilities` are derived from relative frequencies from historical data. This only works if relationships are stable through time. It will not be useful for very rare events. (Relationships must be stable through time for empirical probabilities to be accurate.)\n",
    "- A `priori probabilities` are deduced using logic rather than observation. Both empirical and a priori probabilities are considered objective because they are typically the same for all people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often probabilities are stated as `odds`. If the probability of an event $E$ is $P(E)$, then the odds are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Odds\\ for\\ E=\\frac{P(E)}{1−P(E)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Unconditional probabilities` (a.k.a. marginal probabilities) are based on the universe of all possibilities. They can be thought of as `stand-alone probabilities`.\n",
    "- `Conditional probabilities` restrict the set of possibilities. This is how investors incorporate new information.\n",
    "- A `joint probability` reflects the probability of two or more outcomes occurring. $P(AB)$ represents the probability of A and B occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conditional Probability: P(A | B) \n",
    "$$P(A | B) = \\frac{P(AB)}{P(B)}, P(B) ≠ 0$$ \n",

    "The `correlation` between two sets of returns, $R_i$ and $R_j$, is calculated using the covariance and standard deviations of individual asset returns:\n",
    "$$\\rho(R_i,R_j) = \\rho_{ij} = Corr(R_{i},R_{j}) = \\displaystyle\\frac{Cov(R_{i},R_{j})}{[\\sigma(R_{i})\\sigma(R_{j})]}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$Cov(R_i,R_j) = \\rho(R_i,R_j)σ(R_i)σ(R_j)$\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: right\"> Equation 18</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The above formula are forward-looking, we can similarly compute an historical or sample correlation by dividing historical or sample covariance between two variables by the product of sample standard deviations of the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike covariance, `correlation statistics` are scaled within a **range of -1 to 1**. These relationships can be shown on a scatter plot with returns for one asset on the vertical axis and returns for the other asset on the horizontal axis.\n",
    "- Positive correlations indicate a positive linear relationship. A `perfectly positive` relationship will have a correlation of 1 and will be depicted on a scatter plot as a straight upward sloping line.\n",
    "- Negative correlations indicate a negative linear relationship. A correlation of -1 indicates a `perfectly inverse` relationship.\n",
    "- A correlation of 0 indicates `no LINEAR relationship`. There will be no discernable linear pattern on a scatter plot. *(However, it is important to note that zero correlation does not mean that there is no relationship, only that there is no linear relationship.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitation:\n",
    "- Correlation statistics can be sensitive to `outliers`, so judgment should be used when deciding whether to include observations that are far from the mean.\n",
    "- Correlation does not imply causation. Correlation measures may be spurious if they capture a relationship that occurs by chance or if the relationship between two variables is actually attributable to a relationship that both have with a third variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Covariance Given a Joint Probability Function\n",
    "The calculation of covariance in a forward-looking sense requires the specification of a joint probability function, which gives the probability of joint occurrences of values of the two random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Cov(R_{A},R_{B})=\\displaystyle\\sum_i\\sum_j{P(R_{A,i},R_{B,j})(R_{A,i}−ER_{A})(R_{B,j}−ER_{B})}$\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: right\"> Equation 19</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Sum all possible deviation cross-products weighted by the appropriate joint probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance and correlation measures can be estimated from historical return data or a joint probability function. We can calculate the covariance and correlation between assets based on their probability-weighted returns under different market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this calculation is much simpler if we can assume that two random variables (e.g., returns) are independent of each other. The assumption of independence is stronger than the assumption that two variables are uncorrelated because independence covers any relationship. By contrast, a zero correlation only tells us that there is no linear relationship, but it doesn't tell us anything about the possibility of a non-linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random variables are independent if, and only if, $P(XY)=P(X)P(Y)$. **If two random variables are independent, they must also be uncorrelated. By contrast, knowing that variables are uncorrelated does not allow us to conclude that they are independent.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If two random variables are uncorrelated, then the `multiplication rule` for the expected value of the product of uncorrelated random variables tells us that $E(XY)=E(X)E(Y)$. If we cannot assume that the variables are uncorrelated, we must calculate a conditional expected value."
