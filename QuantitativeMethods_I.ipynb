For example, analysts often refer to the set of companies with returns falling below the 10th percentile cutoff point as the bottom return decile. Dividing data into quantiles based on some characteristic allows analysts to evaluate the impact of that characteristic on a quantity of interest.

The 1st decile contains the portfolio of those companies with the smallest market values, and the 10th decile contains those companies with the largest market value.
