    "## Scope of Financial Statement Analysis\n",
    "Differentiate: \n",
    "- profit/cash flow\n",
    "- liquidity/solvency (`Liquidity` relates to a company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations. `Solvency` refers to the ability to meet long-term obligations.)\n",
    "- assets (resources controlled by the company) in relation to liabilities and equity (the claims against assets). \n",
    "\n",
    "Financial position and capital structure are particularly important in credit analysis. \n",
    "- The **financial position** can be measured by comparing assets and liabilities & equity. \n",
    "- The combination of liabilities and equity used to finance its assets represents the **capital structure** of the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Value shares of a company by comparing its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) to the P/Es of peer companies and/or may use forecasted future earnings as direct or indirect inputs into discounted cash flow models of valuation."

    "## Primary Financial Statements and Other Information Sources\n",
    "Sources of information used in financial statement analysis, including the primary financial statements (statement of financial position or balance sheet, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement). \n",
    "### Statement of Financial Position - Balance Sheet\n",
    "Presents a company’s `financial position` by disclosing the resources the company controls (assets) and its obligations to lenders and other creditors (liabilities) at a specific point in time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Owners’ equity** (sometimes called “net assets”): the excess of assets over liabilities (it's attributable to the company’s owners or shareholders). \n",
    "\n",
    "`International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)` require separate categories for current and non-current assets and liabilities. Asset categories are often sorted by liquidity.\n",
    "#### Accounting Equation (or Balance Sheet Equation)\n",
    "The relationship among the three parts of the balance sheet (assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity) can be expressed in the following equation form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Assets = Liabilities + Owners’\\ equity$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Balance sheets are useful for:\n",
    "- liquidity (ability to meet short-term obligations) improved?\n",
    "- solvent (does it have sufficient resources to cover its obligations)?\n",
    "- financial position relative to the industry?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statement of Comprehensive Income\n",
    "Under IFRS, the statement of comprehensive income can be presented either:\n",
    "- as a single statement of comprehensive income or\n",
    "- as two statements: \n",
    "  - (1) an income statement and \n",
    "  - (2) a statement of comprehensive income (begins with profit or loss from the income statement)\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Income Statement (i.e., Statement of Operations or Profit and Loss Statement)\n",
    "The basic equation underlying the income statement is $$Revenue\\ +\\ Other\\ income\\ –\\ Expenses\\ =\\ Income\\ –\\ Expenses\\ =\\ Net\\ income$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, \n",
    "\n",
    "- revenue typically refers to amounts charged for the delivery of goods or services in the ordinary activities of a business\n",
    "- expenses reflect outflows, `depletions of assets`, and incurrences of liabilities that decrease equity. \n",
    "  - cost of sales (cost of goods sold)\n",
    "  - administrative expenses\n",
    "  - income tax expenses \n",
    "  - may be defined to include losses\n",
    "- net income (`bottom line`) *(may also be referred to as “`net earnings`”, “`net profit`”, and “`profit or loss`”. In the event that expenses exceed revenues and other income, the result is referred to as “`net loss`”.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "`Operating profit` (`earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)`) represents the results of the company’s usual business activities before deducting interest expense or taxes.\n",
    "- `Basic earnings per share` is $\\frac{net\\ income}{number\\ of\\ shares\\ outstanding}$\n",
    "- `Diluted earnings per share` includes shares that would be outstanding if options were exercised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases: \n",
    "- Is the change in revenue related to an increase in units sold, an increase in prices, or some combination?\n",
    "- If the company has multiple business segments (for example, Volkswagen’s segments include passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, and financial services, among others), how are the segments’ revenue and profits changing?\n",
    "- How does the company compare with other companies in the industry?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)\n",
    "OCI includes all items that impact owners’ equity but are **NOT the result of transactions with shareowners**. When comprehensive income is presented in two statements, the statement of comprehensive income begins with the profit or loss from the income statement and then presents the components of OCI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The items in OCI reflect changes in the company’s equity that are not considered to be profit or loss, some of which may be reclassified as such in the future such as unrealized currency translation gains and losses. \n",
    "### Statement of Changes in Equity \n",
    "Serves to reports changes in the owners’ investment in the business over time. It is organized to present, for each component of equity, **the beginning balance, any increases during the period, any decreases during the period, and the ending balance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic components:\n",
    "- `Paid-in capital`:\n",
    "  - an example of an increase is a `new issuance of equity` \n",
    "  - an example of a decrease is a `repurchase` of previously issued stock\n",
    "- `Retained earnings` (income is the most common increase and a `dividend` payment is the most common decrease)\n",
    "    - the cumulative amount of the company’s profits that have been retained in the company\n",
    "    - non-controlling or minority interests \n",
    "    - reserves that represent accumulated OCI items (may be shown separately or included in retained earnings) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cash Flow Statement\n",
    "`Financial flexibility` is the ability of the company to react and adapt to financial adversity and opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cash flow statement classifies all cash flows of the company into three categories: \n",
    "1. operating, \n",
    "2. investing, and \n",
    "3. financing activities. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$the\\ sum\\ of\\ the\\ net\\ cash\\ flows\\ from\\ operating,\\ investing,\\ and\\ financing\\ activities + the\\ effect\\ of\\ exchange\\ rates\\ on\\ cash = net\\ change\\ in\\ cash\\ during\\ the\\ fiscal\\ year$$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cash Flows from Operating Activities** \n",
    "Generally involve the cash effects of transactions involved in the determination of net income and, hence, comprise the day-to-day operations of the company. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cash Flows from Investing Activities**\n",
    "Associated with the acquisition and disposal of **long-term assets**, such as property and equipment. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cash Flows from Financing Activities**\n",
    "Relate to obtaining or repaying capital to be used in the business. \n",
    "\n",
    "IFRS permits more flexibility than US GAAP in classifying dividend and interest receipts and payments within these categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `indirect method` starts with profit before tax, then makes adjustments for taxes paid and non-cash transactions. \n",
    "- The `direct method` shows major categories of cash disbursements and receipts.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the income statement, income is reported **when earned**, not necessarily when cash is received, and expenses are reported **when incurred**, not necessarily when paid. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cash flow statement presents another aspect of performance: the ability of a company to **generate cash flow from running its business**. Ideally, for an established company, the analyst would like to see that the primary source of cash flow is from operating activities.\n",
    "### Financial Notes, Supplementary Schedules, and Management Commentary\n",
    "The notes disclose the basis of preparation for the financial statements. The notes also disclose information about the accounting policies, methods, and estimates used to prepare the financial statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparability of financial statements is a critical requirement for objective financial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases: such information as financial instrument risk, contingencies, and legal proceedings can alert an analyst to risks that can affect a company’s financial position and performance in the future and that require monitoring over time. \n",
    "### Management Commentary\n",
    "This is the section in which management discusses the nature of the business, past results, and future outlook. It is one of the most useful parts of a company’s annual report, but it is usually **unaudited**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)` recommends the following five elements be included:\n",
    "1. The nature of the business; \n",
    "2. Management’s objectives and strategies; \n",
    "3. The company’s significant resources, risks, and relationships; \n",
    "4. Results of operations; and \n",
    "5. Critical performance measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)` requires publicly listed companies in the United States to provide a management’s discussion and analysis and include:\n",
    "1. Any favorable and unfavorable trends\n",
    "2. Information about effects of inflation, changing prices, or other material events\n",
    "3. Off-balance-sheet obligations and contractual commitments\n",
    "4. **Critical accounting policies**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auditor's Reports\n",
    "Under the international standards for auditing (ISAs), the auditor’s objectives are:\n",
    "- Obtain reasonable assurance the financial statements are free from material misstatement and determine if statements are prepared according to the applicable financial reporting framework\n",
    "- Report the findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The auditor cannot provide absolute assurance. Only `reasonable assurance` (high probability) that the statements are free from material error can be given. The report normally has an introductory paragraph, scope paragraph, and opinion paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The opinion can be one of several forms.\n",
    "1. `Unqualified` audit opinions state the financial statements give a true and fair view. This is referred to as a `clean opinion`.\n",
    "2. `Qualified` audit opinions point out limitations or exceptions to the accounting standards.\n",
    "3. `Adverse` audit opinions are issued when the statements materially **depart** from accounting standards.\n",
    "4. A `disclaimer of opinion` occurs when the auditor is unable to issue an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the United States, the `Sarbanes-Oxley Act` requires auditors to provide an additional opinion on the **internal control systems** that companies used to ensure that a sound process is used to prepare financial reports.\n",
    "### Other Sources of Information\n",
    "Information on management and director compensation, company stock performance, and any potential conflicts of interest that may exist between management, the board, and shareholders. \n",
    "\n",
    "This information may appear in the company’s annual report or other publicly available documents. Public companies often provide this information in `proxy statements`, which are distributed to shareholders about matters that are to be put to a vote at the annual (or special) meeting of shareholders. (Disclosure of **management compensation** is required in the proxy statement, and some aspects of management compensation are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Interim reports` (which are not audited) provide updated information on a company’s performance and financial position since the last annual period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies also provide relevant current information on their websites, in press releases, and in conference calls with analysts and investors. One type of press release, which analysts often consider to be particularly important, is the `periodic earnings announcement`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information on the economy, industry, and peer companies is useful in putting the company’s financial performance and position in perspective and in assessing the company’s future. "

    "# Financial Reporting Standards\n",
    "## The Objective of Financial Reporting\n",
    "The Conceptual Framework issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in 2010 defines the purpose of financial reporting as providing information that can be used to help current and potential investors and lenders make investment decisions.\n",
    "## Standard-Setting Bodies and Regulatory Authorities\n",
    "### Accounting Standards Boards\n",
    "Standard-setting bodies, such as the IASB and FASB, are typically private sector, self-regulated organizations with board members who are experienced accountants, auditors, users of financial statements, and academics.<br>\n",
    "#### International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)\n",
    "The IASB is the independent standard-setting body of the IFRS Foundation, an independent, not-for-profit private sector organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring Board that oversees the IASB includes representatives from the European Commission, IOSCO, the Japan Financial Services Agency, and the US SEC.\n",
    "#### Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)\n",
    "US GAAP, as established by the FASB, is officially recognized as authoritative by the SEC, however the SEC retains the authority to establish standards. Although it has rarely overruled the FASB, the SEC does issue authoritative financial reporting guidance including Staff Accounting Bulletins.\n",
    "### Regulatory Authorities\n",
    "Regulators often retain the legal authority to establish financial reporting standards in their jurisdiction and can overrule the private sector standard-setting bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirement to prepare financial reports in accordance with specified accounting standards is the **responsibility** of regulatory authorities.\n",
    "#### International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)\n",
    "Consists of ordinary members, associate members, and affiliate members. \n",
    "- Ordinary members are the securities commission or similar governmental regulatory authority with primary responsibility for securities regulation in the member country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives\n",
    "1. protecting investors;\n",
    "2. ensuring that markets are fair, efficient, and transparent; and\n",
    "3. reducing systemic risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "IOSCO assists in attaining the goal of uniform regulation as well as cross-border co-operation in combating violations of securities and derivatives laws.\n",
    "#### The Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC)\n",
    "Companies comply with these acts principally through the completion and submission (i.e., filing) of standardized forms issued by the SEC. There are more than 50 different types of SEC forms that are used to satisfy reporting requirements. The SEC is responsible for overseeing the PCAOB (Public Companies Accounting Oversight Board) under the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002.\n",
    "##### Common information sources used by analysts:\n",
    "- Securities Offerings Registration Statement: typically includes \n",
    "    - 1) disclosures about the securities being offered for sale\n",
    "    - 2) the relationship of these new securities to the issuer’s other capital securities\n",
    "    - 3) the information typically provided in the annual filings\n",
    "    - 4) recent audited financial statements, and \n",
    "    - 5) risk factors involved in the business\n",
    "- (Annual) Forms 10-K (for US registrants), 20-F (all other non-US registrants), and 40-F(for certain Canadian registrants): The financial disclosures include a historical summary of financial data (usually 10 years), management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and audited financial statements.\n",
    "- Annual Report: The annual report is not a requirement of the SEC.\n",
    "- Proxy Statement/Form DEF-14A: information typically includes proposals that require a shareholder vote, details of security ownership by management and principal owners, biographical information on directors, and disclosure of executive compensation.\n",
    "- Forms 10-Q (quarterly for US companies) and 6-K (semiannually for many non-US companies): for interim periods \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Forms in the event of significant events or transactions \n",
    "- Form 8-K (6-K for non-US registrants): major events such as acquisitions or disposals of corporate assets, changes in securities and trading markets, matters related to accountants and financial statements, corporate governance and management changes, and Regulation FD disclosures.\n",
    "- Forms 3, 4, 5 and 144: Form 3 is the initial statement, Form 4 reports changes, and Form 5 is the annual report. Form 144 is notice of the proposed sale of restricted securities or securities held by an affiliate of the issuer. These forms can be used to examine purchases and sales of securities by officers, directors, and other affiliates of the company, who collectively are regarded as corporate insiders.\n",
    "- Form 11-K: annual report of employee stock purchase, savings, and similar plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Note: A proxy is an authorization from the shareholder giving another party the right to cast its vote.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases: \n",
    "- It might be of interest to analysts for companies with significant employee benefit plans because it contains more information than that disclosed in the company’s financial statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Capital Markets Regulation in Europe\n",
    "From 2005 consolidated accounts of EU listed companies would use International Financial Reporting Standards. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two bodies related to securities regulation established by the European Commission are **the European Securities Committee (ESC)** and **the European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA)**. The ESC consists of high-level representatives of member states and advises the European Commission on securities policy issues. ESMA is an EU cross-border supervisor established to co-ordinate supervision of the EU market. "

    "## International Financial Reporting Standards Framework\n",
    "### The International Financial Reporting Standards Framework\n",
    "`IASB Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting` is designed to assist standard setters in developing and reviewing standards; assist preparers of financial statements in applying standards and in dealing with issues not specifically covered by standard; assist auditors in forming an opinion on financial statements; and assist users in interpreting financial statement information. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Conceptual Framework, the purpose of financial reporting is to provide information that can be useful in helping current and potential providers of capital (e.g., lenders, equity investors) make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital providers are deemed to be the primary users of reports. Different types of capital providers have different needs. For example, lenders will likely analyze different data than equity investors. However, in general, all types of investors require information about a company’s current financial position, performance, and cash flows.\n",
    "#### Qualitative Characteristics of Financial Reports\n",
    "Qualitative characteristics that make financial information useful: \n",
    "1. Fundamental\n",
    "  - `Relevance`: including `materiality`, Information is considered to be material if omission or misstatement of the information could influence users’ decisions. \n",
    "  - `Faithful representation`: completeness, neutrality, and freedom from error.\n",
    "2.  Enhancing\n",
    "  - `Comparability`: information presented in a consistent manner over time and across entities\n",
    "  - `Verifiability`\n",
    "  - `Timeliness`\n",
    "  - `Understandability`\n",
    "3. Constraints \n",
    "  - A balance between costs and benefits. A `cost-benefit analysis` may reveal that the additional time required to make the information more comparable is not worth the incremental benefit to investors.\n",
    "  - Information that is not included.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Elements of Financial Statements\n",
    "1. Elements Directly Related to the Measurement of Financial Position\n",
    "  - Assets (Assets are what a company owns (e.g., inventory and equipment)\n",
    "  - Liabilities (Liabilities are what a company owes (e.g., bank borrowings)\n",
    "  - Equity (Equity is the residual interest in the assets after subtracting the liabilities)\n",
    "2.  Elements Directly Related Performance (Profit and Related Measures) \n",
    "  - Income: Increases in assets, or decreases in liabilities, that result in increases in equity, other than those relating to contributions from holders of equity claims. Income includes both revenues and gains. Revenues represent income from the ordinary activities of the enterprise (e.g., the sale of products or provision of services). Gains may result from ordinary activities or other activities (the sale of surplus equipment). \n",
    "  - Expenses: Decreases in assets, or increases in liabilities, that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to holders of equity claims. Expenses include those related to operating activities such as cost of good sold and operating expenses including wages, rents and other items. Losses are also considered expenses and can result from the sale of assets at less than their carrying values, impairments of asset values and a variety of other items.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Underlying Assumptions in Financial Statements\n",
    "The use of “`accrual accounting`” assumes that financial statements should reflect transactions in the period when they actually occur, not necessarily when cash movements occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "“`Going concern`” refers to the assumption that the company will continue in business for the foreseeable future. \n",
    "#### Recognition of Financial Statement Elements\n",
    "Recognition means that an item is included in the balance sheet or income statement. Recognition is appropriate if it results in both relevant information about assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses and a faithful representation of those items.\n",
    "\n",
    "An item should be recognized on the financial statements if:\n",
    "- it is probable any economic benefit associated with the item will flow to the enterprise; and\n",
    "- the cost or value can be reliably measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measurement of Financial Statement Elements\n",
    "Some alternative bases for measuring elements on the financial statements include \n",
    "- historical cost, \n",
    "- amortized cost, \n",
    "- current cost, \n",
    "- realizable value, \n",
    "- present value, and \n",
    "- fair value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Requirements for Financial Statements\n",
    "IFRS specify the general features, structure, and content of required financial statements, which include the following:\n",
    "- `Statement of financial position`, better known as a balance sheet\n",
    "- `Statement of comprehensive income`, which may be presented in either a single statement or two separate statements\n",
    "- `Statement of changes in equity` to show changes due to profit/loss, other comprehensive income, or transactions with owners\n",
    "- `Statement of cash flows`\n",
    "- `Notes` summarizing accounting policies and other items to help users understand the statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies that adhere to IFRS must provide an explicit statement of compliance in the notes to their financial statements. The following general features are required:\n",
    "- Fair presentation\n",
    "- Going concern\n",
    "- Accrual basis\n",
    "- Materiality and aggregation (each material class of similar items must be presented separately)\n",
    "- No offsetting of assets and liabilities unless required or permitted by IFRS\n",
    "- Reporting must be at least annually\n",
    "- Comparative information to the previous period\n",
    "- Consistency from one period to the next\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structure and Content Requirement\n",
    "- **Classified** Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet): requires the balance sheet to distinguish between current and non-current assets, and between current and non-current liabilities unless a presentation based on liquidity provides more relevant and reliable information (e.g., in the case of a bank or similar financial institution).\n",
    "- Minimum Information on the Face of the Financial Statements\n",
    "- Minimum Information in the Notes (or on the face of financial statements)\n",

    "For analyzing financial statements created under different standards, reconciliation schedules and disclosures regarding the significant differences between the reporting bases—historically available in some jurisdictions—were particularly helpful. \n",
    "### Monitoring Developments in Financial Reporting Standards\n",
    "Analysts can remain aware of developments in financial reporting standards by monitoring new products or transactions, actions of standard setters and other groups representing users of financial statements (such as CFA Institute), and company disclosures regarding critical accounting policies and estimates.\n",
