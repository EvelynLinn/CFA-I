On the income statement, income is reported when earned, not necessarily when cash is received, and expenses are reported when incurred, not necessarily when paid. The cash flow statement presents another aspect of performance: the ability of a company to generate cash flow from running its business. Ideally, for an established company, the analyst would like to see that the primary source of cash flow is from operating activities as opposed to investing or financing activities."

    "### The Elements of Financial Statements\n",
    "#### Elements Directly Related to the Measurement of Financial Position\n",
    "- Assets (Assets are what a company owns (e.g., inventory and equipment)\n",
    "- Liabilities (Liabilities are what a company owes (e.g., bank borrowings)\n",
    "- Equity (Equity is the residual interest in the assets after subtracting the liabilities)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Elements Directly Related Performance (Profit and Related Measures) \n",
    "- Income: Increases in assets, or decreases in liabilities, that result in increases in equity, other than those relating to contributions from holders of equity claims. Income includes both revenues and gains. Revenues represent income from the ordinary activities of the enterprise (e.g., the sale of products or provision of services). Gains may result from ordinary activities or other activities (the sale of surplus equipment). \n",
    "- Expenses: Decreases in assets, or increases in liabilities, that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to holders of equity claims. Expenses include those related to operating activities such as cost of good sold and operating expenses including wages, rents and other items. Losses are also considered expenses and can result from the sale of assets at less than their carrying values, impairments of asset values and a variety of other items.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Underlying Assumptions in Financial Statements\n",
    "The use of “**accrual accounting**” assumes that financial statements should reflect transactions in the period when they actually occur, not necessarily when cash movements occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "“**Going concern**” refers to the assumption that the company will continue in business for the foreseeable future. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recognition of Financial Statement Elements\n",
    "Recognition means that an item is included in the balance sheet or income statement. Recognition is appropriate if it results in both relevant information about assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses and a faithful representation of those items.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measurement of Financial Statement Elements\n",
    "The following alternative bases of measurement are used to different degrees and in varying combinations to measure assets and liabilities:\n",
    "- Historical cost: it's simply the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid to purchase an asset, including any costs of acquisition and/or preparation. \n",
    "- Amortised cost: Historical cost adjusted for amortisation, depreciation, or depletion and/or impairment.\n",
    "- Current cost: \n",
    "    - In reference to assets, current cost is the amount of cash or cash equivalents that would have to be paid to buy the same or an equivalent asset today. \n",
    "    - In reference to liabilities, the current cost basis of measurement means the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents that would be required to settle the obligation today.\n",
    "- Realizable (settlement) value: In reference to assets, realizable value is the amount of cash or cash equivalents that could currently be obtained by selling the asset in an orderly disposal. For liabilities, the equivalent to realizable value is called “settlement value”—that is, settlement value is the undiscounted amount of cash or cash equivalents expected to be paid to satisfy the liabilities in the normal course of business.\n",
    "- Present value (PV): For assets, present value is the present discounted value of the future net cash inflows that the asset is expected to generate in the normal course of business. For liabilities, present value is the present discounted value of the future net cash outflows that are expected to be required to settle the liabilities in the normal course of business.\n",
    "- Fair value: is defined as an exit price, the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date."

    "Analysts can remain aware of developments in financial reporting standards by monitoring new products or transactions, actions of standard setters and other groups representing users of financial statements (such as CFA Institute), and company disclosures regarding critical accounting policies and estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New Products or Types of Transactions\n",
    "New products and new types of transactions can have unusual or unique elements to them such that no explicit guidance in the financial reporting standards exists.\n",

    "#### Evolving Standards and the Role of CFA Institute\n",
    "The [IASB](www.iasb.org) and [FASB](www.fasb.org) provide a great deal of information on their websites regarding new standards and proposals for future changes in standards. "
