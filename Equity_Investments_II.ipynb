    "## Equity Securities in Global Financial Markets\n",
    "The ratio of global equity to global GDP can indicate if markets are over- or undervalued. For example, the US share of global equity markets is approximately twice as large as its share of global GDP. As emerging economies continue to grow, their equity markets can be expected to move toward their proportionate share of global GDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real terms (i.e., net of inflation), equities consistently generate higher returns than either government bonds or government bills. This pattern has been observed across developed economies over more than a century. Of course, equity returns are also more volatile, so investors are expecting higher compensation for the additional risks associated with equities. Equity returns and realized risk premiums have fluctuated over different periods during the 20th and 21st centuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equity ownership rates vary significantly among countries. In many countries, there has a notable decline in equity owners as a share of the total population, particularly in the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crisis."

    "## Types and Characteristics of Equity Securities\n",
    "Companies can finance operations by issuing debt or equity. Debt is a liability for the firm, but equity is not. The company is not obligated to repay equity funds or make periodic payments. Equity holders have a `residual claim` on the company – they get whatever is left. Companies can issue common shares or preference shares.\n",
    "### Common Shares\n",
    "These securities represent ownership in the company. Common shareholders benefit from the operating performance, participate in the governance, and have a residual claim at liquidation. Companies often choose to pay dividends to common shareholders, but they are under no obligation to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shareholders have the right to vote on major decisions. Many choose to vote by `proxy` for convenience, allowing a designated party (e.g., another shareholder, management) to cast their votes on their behalf.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `standard voting system`, known as `statutory voting`, grants one vote for each share owned. `Cumulative voting` allows shareholders to direct all of their votes to specific candidates in board elections. For example, in an election for 10 board seats, a shareholder who owns one share would be given 10 votes with no restrictions on how they may be allocated. The investor could give one vote to a list of 10 candidates, 10 votes to a single candidate, divide them evenly among 2 candidates, etc. The cumulative voting system gives better representation to shareholders who own a relatively small number of shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies can issue multiple classes of shares that differ with respect to voting rights and the priority of their claims in the event of a liquidation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preference Shares (Preferred Stock)\n",
    "Preference shares rank above common stock in terms of dividends and liquidation rights. Unlike common shares, preference shares do not grant any voting rights and owners are generally unable to benefit from any improvement in the issuer's operating performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preference shares are bond-like in that the issuer is contractually obligated to make fixed payments at regular intervals. They may be perpetual or have a fixed maturity date. **Like common shares, they may be callable or putable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*The put option feature facilitates raising capital because the shares are more appealing to investors. As such, it provides a benefit to the issuing company. It also helps investors limit their potential losses because they can sell the shares back to the issuing company if the market price falls below the pre-specified put price. Therefore, putable common shares are beneficial to both the issuing company and the investors.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Preference shares can be classified according to whether they are cumulative or non-cumulative, as well as participating or non-participating.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cumulative preference shares** accrue dividends from missed payments that must be paid before common shares receive dividends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-cumulative preference shares** permanently forfeit any dividend payments that are not made, but no common share dividends can be paid during a period when non-cumulative preferred dividends have gone unpaid\n",
    "\n",
    "**Participating preference shares** can receive an additional dividend if company profits exceed a specified amount. They may also get receive additional distributions (over face value) in the event of a liquidation. These securities tend to be issued by smaller, riskier companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-participating preference shares** do not offer any compensation beyond fixed dividend payments and a claim for their face value in the event of a liquidation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preference shares may also carry an option that allows their owner to convert them into common shares. Convertible preference shares are often used by venture capital and private equity investors because they offer the following advantages:\n",
    "- They are less volatile than common shares while paying higher dividends\n",
    "- If the company is successful, they can be converted into common shares with unlimited upside potential"

    "## Private versus Public Equity Securities\n",
    "`Private equity securities` are issued via private placements, primarily to institutional investors. They are highly illiquid because they do not trade on public exchanges. Types of private equity investments include venture capital, leveraged buyouts, and private investments in public equity.\n",
    "- Venture capital (VC) firms provide start-up capital, early-stage financing, or mezzanine financing. VC investments typically require relatively long-term commitments (i.e., 3 to 10 years). Initial public offerings are often used as an exit strategy.\n",
    "- In a `leveraged buyout (LBO)`, investors raise large amounts of debt to purchase all of a public company's outstanding common stock. If the deal is overseen by managers, it is called a management buyout (MBO). Either way, the company is *taken private*, although investors typically seek to take it public again after it is restructured.\n",
    "- `Private investments in public equity (PIPE)` are used by companies that need to raise capital quickly. Private investors can purchase these equities at a significant discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "The global private equity market is small, but growing rapidly. Private equity holding periods have increased in recent years. As holding periods have increased, private equity investors have increased their reliance on `convertible preference` to provide higher total returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proponents of \"going private\" argue that the absence of short-term pressures allows them to focus on creating long-term value. Private companies also have lower regulatory and compliance costs compared to publicly-listed firms. However, private companies tend to perform worse in terms of corporate governance, perhaps because public companies are subject to more scrutiny from analysts and shareholders."

    "## Investing in Non-Domestic Equity Securities\n",
    "The increasingly integrated global economy has given companies more opportunities to raise capital and invest in other countries and allowed investors to diversify their portfolios. Many companies have chosen to have their shares listed in multiple countries. Lower restrictions on foreign investment provide long-term benefits for equity markets by reducing the cost of capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, countries still impose foreign investor restrictions for three reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "To limit foreign control of domestic companies;\n",
    "To give domestic investors the opportunity to own shares of companies that are conducting business in their country; and\n",
    "To reduce the volatility of capital flows.\n",
    "### Direct Investing\n",
    "The most obvious way to invest in non-domestic stocks is to trade directly in a foreign equity market. All transactions are conducted in the local currency, so investors will experiences gains or losses as a result of exchange rate fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors must be familiar with local trading and settlement procedures or rely on the services of a local agent. Finally, many foreign jurisdictions have relatively low transparency and market liquidity.\n",
    "### Depository Receipts (DR)\n",
    "Depository receipts allow investors to overcome some of the challenges associated with investing directly in foreign markets. A `depository share` represents an economic interest in a foreign company, but it trades on an exchange in the investor's domestic market. A DR can represent any number of the company's shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "The foreign company's shares are deposited in a bank, which then issues receipts that represent the deposits. In its capacity as custodian and registrar, the depository bank handles dividend payments, stock splits, and other taxable events.\n",
    "- A `sponsored DR` is issued directly by the foreign company and investors receive the same dividends and voting rights as other common shareholders. Disclosure requirements are generally more stringent for sponsored DRs.\n",
    "- For an `unsponsored DR`, the foreign company has no involvement. The `depository bank` purchases the company's shares, issues DRs, and retains the voting rights. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Global Depository Receipts\n",
    "GDRs are issued outside the company's home country and are generally exempt from any foreign ownership and capital flow restrictions that may be imposed by that country's government.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most GDRs are traded on exchanges in London and Luxembourg, but many are listed on other exchanges (e.g., Dubai, Singapore). GDRs may be denominated in any currency, but USD is most common.\n",
    "\n",
    "GDRs cannot be listed on US exchanges, but they can be sold to US investors through private placements.\n",
    "#### American Depository Receipts\n",
    "A GDR that can be listed on a US exchange is called an `American Depository Receipt (ADR)`. ADRs are USD-denominated securities that trade like US domestic stocks. The underlying securities, called American depository shares, are traded in the issuing company's domestic market.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four types of ADRs with differing levels of corporate governance and filing requirements. \n",
    "1. Level I Sponsored ADRs trade in the over-the-counter (OTC) market and do not require full registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). \n",
    "2. Level II and III ADRs trade on US exchanges (e.g., NYSE, NASDAQ). They allow companies to raise capital and make acquisitions using these securities. However, the issuing companies must fulfill all SEC requirements.\n",
    "3. The fourth type of ADR, called a Rule 144A depository receipt, is sold to qualified investors through privately placements. (Foreign companies are able to raise capital by privately placing these depository receipts with qualified institutional investors or to offshore non-US investors.) \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Global Registered Shares\n",
    "A global registered share (GRS) is traded on different stock exchanges around the world in different currencies, which eliminates the need for currency conversions. A GRS can be purchased on an exchange in one country for local currency units and sold on another exchange for units of that country's currency. Unlike a DR, a GRS represents an actual ownership interest in the company.\n",
    "#### Basket of Listed Depository Receipts\n",
    "A basket of listed depository receipts is an exchange-traded fund that represents a portfolio of depository receipts. Like other `ETFs` (exchange-traded fund), it trades throughout the day like a normal stock."

    "### Return Characteristics of Equity Securities\n",
    "There are three potential sources of equity returns:\n",
    "1. Price change\n",
    "2. Dividend income\n",
    "3. Foreign exchange gains or losses\n",
    "Relatively young companies typically do not pay dividends, so returns on these equities are entirely attributable to price appreciation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors who focus exclusively on price appreciation overlook the potential for significantly higher returns from reinvesting dividends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign exchange gains are available to investors who either purchase depository receipts or invest directly in foreign equity markets. From their perspective, returns are enhanced if the foreign currency appreciates relative to their domestic currency\n",
    "\n",
    "The compound effect of reinvested dividends is very important over the long term.\n",
    "### Risk of Equity Securities\n",
    "Risk is often measured by the **standard deviation of the expected total return**. Historical data is frequently used as a proxy for expected volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preference shares are less risky than common shares because dividends are fixed, preferred dividends must be paid before any common share dividends, and the liquidation value is known. As a result, investors require less compensation for holding preference shares.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Putable shares` also have less downside risk because they have a floor value. \n",
    "- `Callable shares` typically pay higher dividends to compensate investors for the loss of upside if they are recalled by the issuer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*`Putable shares`, whether common or preference, give the investor the option to sell the shares back to the issuer at a pre-determined price. This pre-determined price creates a floor for the share’s price that reduces the uncertainty of future cash flows for the investor (i.e., lowers risk relative to the other two types of shares listed).*\n",
    "\n",
    "*`Callable` common or preference shares are riskier than their non-callable counterparts because the issuer has the option to redeem the shares at a pre-determined price. Because the call price limits investors’ potential future total return, callable shares generally pay a higher dividend to compensate investors for the risk that the shares could be called in the future.*"

    "## Equity and Company Value\n",
    "Role of equity securities in creating company value and the relationship between a company’s cost of equity, its return on equity, and investors’ required rate of return. (Compare a company’s cost of equity, its (accounting) return on equity, and investors’ required rates of return.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies issue equity to *raise capital and increase liquidity*. The funds can be used to buy long-lived assets, fund research and development, or acquire other companies. It could also be used to improve capital adequacy ratios or fund existing debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, managers seek to increase the `book value` of equity on the company's balance sheet and maximize the `market value` of equity for shareholders. Managerial decisions can have a direct impact on book value, but only an indirect impact on market value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `book value` of a company’s equity—the difference between its `total assets` and `total liabilities`—increases when the company retains its net income. The more net income that is earned and retained, the greater the company’s book value of equity. Because management’s decisions directly influence a company’s net income, they also directly influence its book value of equity.\n",
    "### Accounting Return on Equity\n",
    "#### ROE\n",
    "Return on equity ($ROE$) is used to judge management's efficiency in using capital. It is the net income divided by the average book value of equity ($BVE$).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ROE_t=\\frac{NI_t}{\\frac{(BVE_t+BVE_{t−1})}{2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be accepted to use only the beginning book value of equity in the denominator if the company's book value has been relatively stable. An average is preferred if book values have been volatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysts must recognize that net income and BVE can be affected by management's choices regarding accounting policies. Adjustments may be required for ROE comparisons among companies that have different accounting policies or even a time-series analysis of a company that has changed its policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "An increase in ROE is not necessarily a positive sign. A company with slowing sales can post higher ROE if net income decreases at a slower rate than BVE. Alternatively, issuing debt and using the proceeds to repurchase shares will increase ROE while increasing both a company's leverage and the riskiness of its equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the book value of equity reflects the `historical operating and financing decisions` of management, the market value reflects investors' `expectations of future cash flows`. The market value of equity is simply the market price per share times the number of shares outstanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P/B Ratio\n",
    "The `price-to-book ratio` (or `market-to-book ratio`) reflects `investor sentiment`. A higher ratio indicates greater optimism about the company's future investment opportunities. However, P/B ratios should not be used to compare companies in different industries because this measure also reflects investors' opinions about a company's sector.\n",

    "$$Adjusted\\ book\\ value\\ per\\ share = \\frac{(Adjusted\\ value\\ of\\ Assets−Total\\ liabilities)}{Number\\ of\\ shares}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Book value and ROE are less useful for analysts seeking to estimate a company's `intrinsic value`, which is **the present value of expected future cash flows**. Investors seek to profit from the difference between a company's market price and its intrinsic value.\n",
    "### Cost of Equity and Investors' Required Rates of Return\n",
    "The cost of equity is not easily determined. It is dependent on investors’ required rate of return on equity, which reflects the different risk levels of investors and their expectations about the company’s future cash flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shareholder value is maximized by minimizing the cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) considers both after-tax debt and equity costs. WACC is the minimum return that a company must earn on its long-term investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of debt (or interest rate) is easy to measure because borrowers are required to make periodic interest payments. By contrast, the minimum rate of return required by equity investors can only be estimated. Models to estimate the company's cost of equity (e.g., CAPM, DDM) are covered in other readings."
