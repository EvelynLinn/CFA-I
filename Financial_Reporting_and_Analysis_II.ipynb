    "\n",
    "In IFRS, the term “income” includes revenue and gains. Gains are similar to revenue, but they typically arise from secondary or peripheral activities rather than from a company’s primary business activities. Similarly, a loss typically arises from secondary activities. Gains and losses may be considered part of operating activities (e.g., a loss due to a decline in the value of inventory) or may be considered part of non-operating activities (e.g., the sale of non-trading investments).\n",

    "There are situations when a company receives cash in advance and actually delivers the product or service later, perhaps over a period of time. In this case, the company would record a liability for unearned revenue when the cash is initially received, and revenue would be recognized as being earned over time as products and services are delivered. An example would be a subscription payment received for a publication that is to be delivered periodically over time."

    "#### Accounting Standards for Revenue Recognition\n",
    "The core principle of the converged standard is that revenue should be recognized to “depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in an exchange for those goods or services.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Five steps in recognizing revenue\n",
    "1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer\n",
    "2. Identify the separate or distinct performance obligations in the contract\n",
    "3. Determine the transaction price\n",
    "4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n",
    "5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation (The performance obligations within a contract represent promises to transfer distinct good(s) or service(s))\n",
    "\n",
    "When revenue is recognized, a contract asset is presented on the balance sheet. It is only at the point when all performance obligations have been met except for payment that a receivable appears on the seller’s balance sheet. If consideration is received in advance of transferring good(s) or service(s), the seller presents a contract liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case revenues are reversed:\n",
    "The balance sheet will be required to reflect the entire refund obligation as a liability and will include an asset for the “right to returned goods” based on the carrying amount of inventory less costs of recovery."

In particular, incremental costs of obtaining a contract and certain costs incurred to fulfill a contract must be capitalized under the new standards (i.e., reported as an asset on the balance sheet rather than as an expense on the income statement).

    "## Expense Recognition: General Principles\n",
    "basic principles and selected applications related to the recognition of expenses。\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the IASB Conceptual Framework, expenses are “decreases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of outflows or depletions of assets or incurrences of liabilities that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to equity participants.”\n",
    "\n",
    "They usually take the form of an outflow or depletion of assets such as cash and cash equivalents, inventory, property, plant and equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Principles: Matching Principle\n",
    "a company recognizes some expenses (e.g., cost of goods sold) when associated revenues are recognized and thus, expenses and revenues are matched. Matching requires that a company recognizes cost of goods sold in the same period as revenues from the sale of the goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Period costs, expenditures that less directly match revenues, are reflected in the period when a company makes the expenditure or incurs the liability to pay. Administrative expenses are an example of period costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other expenditures that also less directly match revenues relate more directly to future expected benefits; in this case, the expenditures are allocated systematically with the passage of time. An example is depreciation expense.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FIFO and Weighted Average Cost Methods\n",
    "Specific identification method and inventory and cost of goods sold are based on their physical flow. It is generally not feasible to specifically identify which items were sold and which remain on hand, so accounting standards permit the assignment of inventory costs to costs of goods sold and to ending inventory using cost formulas (IFRS terminology) or cost flow assumptions (US GAAP).\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost formula or cost flow assumption determines which goods are assumed to be sold and which goods are assumed to remain in inventory. Both IFRS and US GAAP permit the use of the first in, first out (FIFO) method, and the weighted average cost method to assign costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the FIFO method, the oldest goods purchased (or manufactured) are assumed to be sold first and the newest goods purchased (or manufactured) are assumed to remain in inventory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The weighted average cost method assigns the average cost of goods available for sale to the units sold and remaining in inventory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another method is permitted under US GAAP but is not permitted under IFRS. This is the last in, first out (LIFO) method. Under the LIFO method, the newest goods purchased (or manufactured) are assumed to be sold first and the oldest goods purchased (or manufactured) are assumed to remain in inventory. "

    "Long-lived assets are assets expected to provide economic benefits over a future period of time greater than one year.

The costs of most long-lived assets are allocated over the period of time during which they provide economic benefits. \n",

    "- Acceleration factor: this rate is (then) applied to the remaining undepreciated balance of the asset each period (known as the net book value).

    "Comparing the two larger companies, Company A reports significantly higher gross profit as a percentage of sales than does Company B (70 percent compared with 25 percent). Given that both companies operate in the same industry, why can Company A generate so much higher gross profit? One possible explanation is found by comparing the operating expenses of the two companies. Company A spends significantly more on research and development and on advertising than Company B. Expenditures on research and development likely result in products with superior technology. Expenditures on advertising likely result in greater brand awareness. So, based on these differences, it is likely that Company A is selling technologically superior products with a better brand image. Company B may be selling its products more cheaply (with a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales) but saving money by not investing in research and development or advertising. \n",

To project the companies’ future net income, an analyst would project the companies’ pretax income and apply an estimated effective tax rate determined in part by the historical tax rates.\n",

    "## Assets\n",
    "### Non-Current Assets\n",
    "#### Property, Plant and Equipment \n",
    "Property, plant, and equipment (PPE) are tangible assets that are used in company operations and expected to be used (provide economic benefits) over more than one fiscal period. Including land, buildings, equipment, machinery, furniture, and natural resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "IFRS permits companies to report PPE using either a cost model or a revaluation model. US GAAP permits only the cost model for reporting PPE. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cost Model\n",
    "PPE is carried at amortised cost (historical cost less any accumulated depreciation or accumulated depletion, and less any impairment losses). Historical cost generally consists of an asset’s purchase price, plus its delivery cost, and any other additional costs incurred to make the asset operable (such as costs to install a machine). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because PPE is presented on the balance sheet net of depreciation and depreciation expense is recognised in the income statement, the choice of depreciation method and the related estimates of useful life and salvage value impact both a company’s balance sheet and income statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impairment losses reflect an unanticipated decline in value. When an asset is considered impaired, the company recognizes the impairment loss in the income statement in the period the impairment is identified. Reversals of impairment losses are permitted under IFRS but not under US GAAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Revaluation Model\n",
    "The reported and carrying value for PPE is the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation. Changes in the value of PPE under the revaluation model affect equity directly or profit and loss depending upon the circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Investment Property\n",
    "Some property is not used in the production of goods or services or for administrative purposes. Instead, it is used to earn rental income or capital appreciation (or both). \n",
    "\n",
    "IFRS provides companies with the choice to report investment property using either a cost model or a fair value model. Under the fair value model, investment property is carried at its fair value. When a company uses the fair value model to measure the value of its investment property, any gain or loss arising from a change in the fair value of the investment property is recognized in profit and loss, i.e., on the income statement, in the period in which it arises. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### (Identifiable) Intangible Assets\n",
    "Identifiable non-monetary assets without physical substance (either internally-created or acquired). E.g. patents, trademarks, copyrights, franchises, licenses, and other rights. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each intangible asset, a company assesses whether the useful life of the asset is finite or indefinite. Amortisation and impairment principles apply as follows:\n",
    "- with a finite useful life: amortised on a systematic basis over the best estimate of its useful life, with the amortisation method and useful life estimate reviewed at least annually.\n",
    "- Impairment principles for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are the same as for PPE.\n",
    "- An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortised. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### IFRS\n",
    "1. Identifiable intangible assets are recognised on the balance sheet if it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the company and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. \n",
    "2. Allows companies to report intangible assets using either a cost model or a revaluation model. *(Note:The revaluation model can only be selected when there is an active market for an intangible asset.)*\n",
    "3. For internally created intangible assets: the company must \n",
    "    - separately identify the research phase and the development phase. \n",
    "    - costs to internally generate intangible assets during the research phase must be expensed on the income statement\n",
    "    - Costs incurred in the development stage can be capitalized as intangible assets if certain criteria are met. Note: administrative costs are not capitalized. *(including technological feasibility, the ability to use or sell the resulting asset, and the ability to complete the project.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### GAAP\n",
    "US GAAP prohibits the capitalization as an asset of most costs of internally developed intangibles and research and development. All such costs usually must be expensed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Common Ground\n",
    "- Under IFRS and US GAAP, the general requirement is that internally created identifiable intangibles are expensed rather than reported on the balance sheet.\n",
    "- Generally, acquired intangible assets are reported as separately identifiable intangibles (as opposed to goodwill) if they arise from contractual rights (such as a licensing agreement), other legal rights (such as patents), or have the ability to be separated and sold (such as a customer list).\n",
    "- Costs related to the following categories are typically expensed under IFRS and US GAAP. They include:\n",
    "  - internally generated brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer lists, etc.;\n",
    "  - start-up costs;\n",
    "  - training costs;\n",
    "  - administrative and other general overhead costs;\n",
    "  - advertising and promotion;\n",
    "  - relocation and reorganization expenses; and\n",
    "  - redundancy and other termination costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases (intangible assets): In assessing financial statements, analysts often exclude the book value assigned to intangibles, reducing net equity by an equal amount and increasing pretax income by any amortisation expense or impairment associated with the intangibles. An arbitrary assignment of zero value to intangibles is not advisable; instead, an analyst should examine each listed intangible and assess whether an adjustment should be made. Note disclosures about intangible assets may provide useful information to the analyst. These disclosures include information about useful lives, amortisation rates and methods, and impairment losses recognised or reversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goodwill\n",
    "When one company acquires another, the purchase price is allocated to all the identifiable assets (tangible and intangible) and liabilities acquired, based on fair value. If the purchase price is greater than the acquirer’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, the excess amount is recognized as an asset, described as goodwill. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Capitalization (Recognition)\n",
    "Under both IFRS and US GAAP, accounting goodwill arising from acquisitions is capitalized. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually. If goodwill is deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss is charged against income in the current period. An impairment loss reduces current earnings. An impairment loss also reduces total assets, so some performance measures, such as return on assets (net income divided by average total assets), may actually increase in future periods. An impairment loss is a non-cash item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accounting standards’ requirements for recognizing goodwill can be summarized by the following steps:\n",
    "1. The total cost to purchase the target company (the acquiree) is determined.\n",
    "2.  The acquiree’s identifiable assets are measured at fair value. The acquiree’s liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value. The difference between the fair value of identifiable assets and the fair value of the liabilities and contingent liabilities equals the net identifiable assets acquired.\n",
    "3. Goodwill arising from the purchase is the excess of a) the cost to purchase the target company over b) the net identifiable assets acquired. Occasionally, a transaction will involve the purchase of net identifiable assets with a value greater than the cost to purchase. Such a transaction is called a “bargain purchase.” Any gain from a bargain purchase is recognized in profit and loss in the period in which it arises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases: <br>\n",
    "- Analysts should distinguish between accounting goodwill and economic goodwill. Economic goodwill is based on the economic performance of the entity, whereas accounting goodwill is based on accounting standards and is reported only in the case of acquisitions. Economic goodwill is important to analysts and investors, and it is not necessarily reflected on the balance sheet. Instead, economic goodwill is reflected in the stock price (at least in theory). Some financial statement users believe that goodwill should not be listed on the balance sheet, because it cannot be sold separately from the entity. These financial statement users believe that only assets that can be separately identified and sold should be reflected on the balance sheet. Other financial statement users analyze goodwill and any subsequent impairment charges to assess management’s performance on prior acquisitions.\n",
    "- The recognition and impairment of goodwill can significantly affect the comparability of financial statements between companies. Therefore, analysts often adjust the companies’ financial statements by removing the impact of goodwill. Such adjustments include:\n",
    "    1. excluding goodwill from balance sheet data used to compute financial ratios, and\n",
    "    2. excluding goodwill impairment losses from income data used to examine operating trends.\n",
    "- Analysts can develop expectations about a company’s performance following an acquisition by taking into account the purchase price paid relative to the net assets and earnings prospects of the acquired company.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Financial Assets\n",
    "IFRS define a financial instrument as a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity, and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Derivatives are financial instruments for which the value is derived based on some underlying factor (interest rate, exchange rate, commodity price, security price, or credit rating) and for which little or no initial investment is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognition: \n",
    "Financial assets not measured at amortised cost subsequent to acquisition are measured at fair value as of the reporting date. For financial instruments measured at fair value, there are two basic alternatives in how net changes in fair value are recognized: as profit or loss on the income statement, or as other comprehensive income (loss) which bypasses the income statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### IFRS\n",
    "At fair value or amortised cost. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market transaction. The amortised cost of a financial asset (or liability) is the amount at which it was initially recognized, minus any principal repayments, plus or minus any amortisation of discount or premium, and minus any reduction for impairment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under IFRS, financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if the asset’s cash flows occur on specified dates and consist solely of principal and interest, and if the business model is to hold the asset to maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under IFRS, financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (i.e., any unrealized holding gains or losses are recognized in other comprehensive income) if the business model’s objective involves both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets. This IFRS category applies specifically to debt investments, namely assets with cash flows occurring on specified dates and consisting solely of principal and interest. However, IFRS also permits equity investments to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if, at the time a company buys an equity investment, the company decides to make an irrevocable election to measure the asset in this manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### GAAP\n",
    "\"Held-to-maturity\": Debt (fixed-income) securities that a company intends to hold to maturity; these are presented at their original cost, updated for any amortisation of discounts or premiums.\n",
    "Other types of financial assets measured at historical cost are loans to other companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept is similar to the US GAAP investment category available-for-sale in which assets are measured at fair value, with any unrealized holding gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income. However, unlike IFRS, the US GAAP category available-for-sale applies only to debt securities and is not permitted for investments in equity securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deferred Tax Assets\n",
    "A balance sheet asset that arises when an excess amount is paid for income taxes relative to accounting profit. The taxable income is higher than accounting profit and income tax payable exceeds tax expense. The company expects to recover the difference during the course of future operations when tax expense exceeds income tax payable.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Income taxes incurred prior to the time that the income tax expense will be recognized on the income statement.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Actual income tax payable based on income that exceeds financial statement income<br>\n",
    "Deferred tax assets may result when the actual income tax payable based on income for tax purposes in a period exceeds the amount of income tax expense based on the reported financial statement income due to temporary timing differences. When the income is subsequently recognized on the income statement, the related tax expense is also recognized which will reduce the deferred tax asset.\n",
    "2. Financial statement income before taxes is less than taxable income<br>\n",
    "Also, a company may claim certain expenses for financial statement purposes that it is only allowed to claim in subsequent periods for tax purposes. In this case, as in the previous example, the financial statement income before taxes is less than taxable income. Thus, income taxes payable based on taxable income exceeds income tax expense based on accounting net income before taxes. The difference is expected to reverse in the future when the income reported on the financial statements exceeds the taxable income as a deduction for the expense becomes allowed for tax purposes. \n",
    "3. Carrying forward unused tax losses and credits <br>\n",
    "Deferred tax assets may also result from carrying forward unused tax losses and credits (these are not temporary timing differences). Deferred tax assets are only to be recognized if there is an expectation that there will be taxable income in the future, against which the temporary difference or carried forward tax losses or credits can be applied to reduce taxes payable."

    "#### Long-Term Financial Liabilities\n",
    "include loans (i.e., borrowings from banks) and notes or bonds payable (i.e., fixed-income securities issued to investors). \n",
    "\n",
    "Liabilities such as loans payable and bonds payable are usually reported at amortised cost on the balance sheet. At maturity, the amortised cost of the bond (carrying amount) will be equal to the face value of the bond. Similarly, any bond premium would be amortised for bonds issued at a price in excess of face or par value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In certain cases, liabilities such as bonds issued by a company are reported at fair value. Those cases include financial liabilities held for trading, derivatives that are a liability to the company, and some non-derivative instruments such as those which are hedged by derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deferred Tax Liabilities\n",
    "Deferred tax liabilities result from temporary timing differences between a company’s income as reported for tax purposes (taxable income) and income as reported for financial statement purposes (reported income). Deferred tax liabilities result when **taxable income and the actual income tax payable in a period based on it is less than the reported financial statement income before taxes and the income tax expense based on it**. Deferred tax liabilities are defined as the amounts of income taxes payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deferred tax liabilities typically arise when items of expense are included in taxable income in earlier periods than for financial statement net income. This results in taxable income being less than income before taxes in the earlier periods. As a result, taxes payable based on taxable income are less than income tax expense based on accounting income before taxes. The difference between taxes payable and income tax expense results in a deferred tax liability—for example, when companies use accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes and straight-line depreciation methods for financial statement purposes. Deferred tax liabilities also arise when items of income are included in taxable income in later periods—for example, when a company’s subsidiary has profits that have not yet been distributed and thus have not yet been taxed."
