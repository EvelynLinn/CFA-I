    "\n",
    "In IFRS, the term “income” includes revenue and gains. Gains are similar to revenue, but they typically arise from secondary or peripheral activities rather than from a company’s primary business activities. Similarly, a loss typically arises from secondary activities. Gains and losses may be considered part of operating activities (e.g., a loss due to a decline in the value of inventory) or may be considered part of non-operating activities (e.g., the sale of non-trading investments).\n",

    "\n",
    "There are situations when a company receives cash in advance and actually delivers the product or service later, perhaps over a period of time. In this case, the company would record a liability for unearned revenue when the cash is initially received, and revenue would be recognized as being earned over time as products and services are delivered. An example would be a subscription payment received for a publication that is to be delivered periodically over time."

    "#### Accounting Standards for Revenue Recognition\n",
    "The core principle of the converged standard is that revenue should be recognized to “depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in an exchange for those goods or services.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Five steps in recognizing revenue\n",
    "1. Identify the contract(s) with a customer\n",
    "2. Identify the separate or distinct performance obligations in the contract\n",
    "3. Determine the transaction price\n",
    "4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n",
    "5. Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation (The performance obligations within a contract represent promises to transfer distinct good(s) or service(s))\n",
    "\n",
    "When revenue is recognized, a contract asset is presented on the balance sheet. It is only at the point when all performance obligations have been met except for payment that a receivable appears on the seller’s balance sheet. If consideration is received in advance of transferring good(s) or service(s), the seller presents a contract liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case revenues are reversed:\n",
    "The balance sheet will be required to reflect the entire refund obligation as a liability and will include an asset for the “right to returned goods” based on the carrying amount of inventory less costs of recovery."

In particular, incremental costs of obtaining a contract and certain costs incurred to fulfill a contract must be capitalized under the new standards (i.e., reported as an asset on the balance sheet rather than as an expense on the income statement).

    "## Expense Recognition: General Principles\n",
    "basic principles and selected applications related to the recognition of expenses。\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the IASB Conceptual Framework, expenses are “decreases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of outflows or depletions of assets or incurrences of liabilities that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to equity participants.”\n",
    "\n",
    "They usually take the form of an outflow or depletion of assets such as cash and cash equivalents, inventory, property, plant and equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Principles: Matching Principle\n",
    "a company recognizes some expenses (e.g., cost of goods sold) when associated revenues are recognized and thus, expenses and revenues are matched. Matching requires that a company recognizes cost of goods sold in the same period as revenues from the sale of the goods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Period costs, expenditures that less directly match revenues, are reflected in the period when a company makes the expenditure or incurs the liability to pay. Administrative expenses are an example of period costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other expenditures that also less directly match revenues relate more directly to future expected benefits; in this case, the expenditures are allocated systematically with the passage of time. An example is depreciation expense.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FIFO and Weighted Average Cost Methods\n",
    "Specific identification method and inventory and cost of goods sold are based on their physical flow. It is generally not feasible to specifically identify which items were sold and which remain on hand, so accounting standards permit the assignment of inventory costs to costs of goods sold and to ending inventory using cost formulas (IFRS terminology) or cost flow assumptions (US GAAP).\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost formula or cost flow assumption determines which goods are assumed to be sold and which goods are assumed to remain in inventory. Both IFRS and US GAAP permit the use of the first in, first out (FIFO) method, and the weighted average cost method to assign costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the FIFO method, the oldest goods purchased (or manufactured) are assumed to be sold first and the newest goods purchased (or manufactured) are assumed to remain in inventory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The weighted average cost method assigns the average cost of goods available for sale to the units sold and remaining in inventory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another method is permitted under US GAAP but is not permitted under IFRS. This is the last in, first out (LIFO) method. Under the LIFO method, the newest goods purchased (or manufactured) are assumed to be sold first and the oldest goods purchased (or manufactured) are assumed to remain in inventory. "

    "#### Depreciation \n",
    "Long-lived assets are assets expected to provide economic benefits over a future period of time greater than one year.

The costs of most long-lived assets are allocated over the period of time during which they provide economic benefits. \n",

    "- Straight-line rate\n",
    "- Acceleration factor: this rate is (then) applied to the remaining undepreciated balance of the asset each period (known as the net book value).

    "Comparing the two larger companies, Company A reports significantly higher gross profit as a percentage of sales than does Company B (70 percent compared with 25 percent). Given that both companies operate in the same industry, why can Company A generate so much higher gross profit? One possible explanation is found by comparing the operating expenses of the two companies. Company A spends significantly more on research and development and on advertising than Company B. Expenditures on research and development likely result in products with superior technology. Expenditures on advertising likely result in greater brand awareness. So, based on these differences, it is likely that Company A is selling technologically superior products with a better brand image. Company B may be selling its products more cheaply (with a lower gross profit as a percentage of sales) but saving money by not investing in research and development or advertising. \n",

Using note disclosure, an analyst can then examine the causes for differences in effective tax rates. To project the companies’ future net income, an analyst would project the companies’ pretax income and apply an estimated effective tax rate determined in part by the historical tax rates.\n",
