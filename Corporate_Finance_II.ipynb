    "## Leverage\n",
    "Leverage is the use of fixed costs in a company’s cost structure. Fixed costs that are operating costs (such as depreciation or rent) create operating leverage. Fixed costs that are financial costs (such as interest expense) create financial leverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the degree of leverage is an important component in assessing a company’s risk and return characteristics. Second, analysts may be able to discern information about a company’s business and future prospects from management’s decisions about the use of operating and financial leverage. Knowing how to interpret these signals also helps the analyst evaluate the quality of management’s decisions. Third, the valuation of a company requires forecasting future cash flows and assessing the risk associated with those cash flows. Understanding a company’s use of leverage should help in forecasting cash flows and in selecting an appropriate discount rate for finding their present value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leverage increases the volatility of a company’s earnings and cash flows and increases the risk of lending to or owning a company. Additionally, the valuation of a company and its equity is affected by the degree of leverage: The greater a company’s leverage, the greater its risk and, hence, the greater the discount rate that should be applied in its valuation. Further, highly leveraged (levered) companies have a greater chance of incurring significant losses during downturns, thus accelerating conditions that lead to financial distress and bankruptcy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk associated with future earnings and cash flows of a company are affected by the company’s cost structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cost structure of a company is the mix of variable and fixed costs. \n",
    "- Variable costs fluctuate with the level of production and sales.\n",
    "  - cost of goods purchased for resale, \n",
    "  - costs of materials or supplies, \n",
    "  - shipping charges, \n",
    "  - delivery charges, \n",
    "  - wages for hourly employees, \n",
    "  - sales commissions, and \n",
    "  - sales or production bonuses. \n",
    "- Fixed costs are expenses that are the same regardless of the production and sales of the company. \n",
    "  - depreciation, \n",
    "  - rent, \n",
    "  - interest on debt, \n",

    "The greater leverage of Impulse Robotics is reflected in the greater slope of the line representing net income. Companies that have more fixed costs relative to variable costs in their cost structures have greater variation in net income as revenues fluctuate and, hence, more risk."

    "We can represent the degree of operating leverage as given in Equation 1 in terms of the basic elements of the `price per unit`, `variable cost per unit`, `number of units sold`, and `fixed operating costs`. Operating income is revenue minus total operating costs (with variable and fixed cost components): \n",

    "The `per unit contribution margin` is the amount that each unit sold contributes to covering fixed costs—that is, the difference between the price per unit and the variable cost per unit. That difference multiplied by the quantity sold is the contribution margin, which equals revenue minus variable costs.\n",

    "Industries that tend to have high operating leverage are those that invest up front to produce a product but spend relatively little on making and distributing it. Software developers and pharmaceutical companies fit this description. Alternatively, retailers have low operating leverage because much of the cost of goods sold is variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because most companies produce more than one product, the ratio of variable to fixed costs is difficult to obtain. We can get an idea of the operating leverage of a company by looking at changes in operating income in relation to changes in sales for the entire company. This relation can be estimated by regressing changes in operating income (the variable to be explained) on changes in sales (the explanatory variable) over a recent time period."
