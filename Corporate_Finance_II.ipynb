    "## Leverage\n",
    "Leverage is the use of fixed costs in a company’s cost structure. Fixed costs that are operating costs (such as depreciation or rent) create operating leverage. Fixed costs that are financial costs (such as interest expense) create financial leverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the degree of leverage is an important component in assessing a company’s risk and return characteristics. Second, analysts may be able to discern information about a company’s business and future prospects from management’s decisions about the use of operating and financial leverage. Knowing how to interpret these signals also helps the analyst evaluate the quality of management’s decisions. Third, the valuation of a company requires forecasting future cash flows and assessing the risk associated with those cash flows. Understanding a company’s use of leverage should help in forecasting cash flows and in selecting an appropriate discount rate for finding their present value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leverage increases the volatility of a company’s earnings and cash flows and increases the risk of lending to or owning a company. Additionally, the valuation of a company and its equity is affected by the degree of leverage: The greater a company’s leverage, the greater its risk and, hence, the greater the discount rate that should be applied in its valuation. Further, highly leveraged (levered) companies have a greater chance of incurring significant losses during downturns, thus accelerating conditions that lead to financial distress and bankruptcy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk associated with future earnings and cash flows of a company are affected by the company’s cost structure. \n",

    "The cost structure of a company is the mix of variable and fixed costs. \n",

    "- the `bond equivalent basis` (also referred to as the `investment yield basis`). \n",

    "- A `mismatching strategy` is riskier and requires very accurate and reliable cash forecasts. These strategies usually use securities that are more liquid, such as T-bills, so that securities can be liquidated if adverse market conditions arise. Mismatching strategies may also be accomplished using `derivatives`, which may pose additional risks to a company unaccustomed to buying and selling derivatives.\n",

    "#### Just-in-Time\n",
    "It minimizes in-process inventory stocks—raw materials and in production—by evaluating the entire system of the delivery of materials and production. Materials are ordered, for example, at a point at which current stocks of material reach a reorder point, a point determined primarily by historical demand. Materials or `manufacturing resource planning (MRP)` systems incorporate production planning into inventory management. \n",

    "The component costs include:\n",
    "- Ordering. Procurement or replenishment costs, both of which may be fixed or variable. These costs depend on the number of orders placed. Examples: freight, labor and handling, paperwork, machine setup.\n",
    "- Carrying. Financing and holding costs, which are opportunity or real costs. These costs depend on average inventory levels and the type of goods. Examples: storage, capital costs, obsolescence, insurance, and taxes.\n",
    "- Stock-out. Opportunity or real costs, which are affected by level of inventory, item mix, processing time versus term of sale. These costs might vary greatly depending on how they are estimated. Examples: lost sales, back-order costs, substitution costs.\n",
    "- Policy. Costs of gathering data and general operating costs, which may be real costs or “soft” costs. These costs depend on inventory mix and complexity. Examples: data processing, labor charges, overtime, training.\n",

On the other hand, a decrease in inventory turnover may indicate a change in the company’s product mix, or it may mean that the company is reducing its risk of inventory stock-outs."

    "One key activity that companies should review from time to time is the evaluation of trade discounts. Trade discounts should be evaluated using the formula shown below, which computes the implicit rate (of return) that is represented by the trade discount offer; that is, it is the equivalent return to the customer of an alternative investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implicit rate is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Cost\\ of\\ trade\\ credit=\\Big(1+\\frac{Discount}{1−Discount}\\Big)^{(\\frac{365}{Number\\ of\\ days\\ beyond\\ discount\\ period})}−1$$\n",
    "The cost of funds during the discount period is 0 percent, so it is beneficial for the customer to pay close to the end of the discount period. Once the discount period ends, the cost of the credit to the customer jumps up and then declines as the net day is approached. \n",

    "## Managing Short-Term Financing\n",
    "Too often companies do not explore their options sufficiently, and as a result, they do not take advantage of cost savings that some forms of borrowing offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lack of awareness usually indicates that a company’s treasurer may not be familiar with the common forms of short-term borrowing and has not factored them into an effective borrowing strategy.\n",
    "### Sources of Short-Term Financing\n",
    "#### Bank Sources \n",
    "##### Uncommitted lines of credit \n",
    "Cannot be shown as a financial reserve in a footnote to the company’s financial statements. The primary attraction is that they do not require any compensation other than interest.\n",
    "##### Committed Lines of Credit\n",
    "a.k.a `regular lines of credit`. These lines of credit are in effect for 364 days (one day short of a full year). Usually classified as `notes payable or the equivalent` on the financial statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regular lines are `unsecured` and are `pre-payable` without any penalties. \n",
    "- The borrowing rate is a negotiated item. \n",
    "- The most common interest rates negotiated are borrowing at the bank’s `prime rate` or at a `money market rate` plus a `spread`. \n",
    "  - The most common money market rate is an offshore rate—the London interbank offered rate (Libor), which is a Eurodollar rate—plus a spread. \n",
    "  - The spread varies depending on the borrower’s credit-worthiness. \n",
    "- Regular lines require `compensation`, usually in the form of a `commitment fee`. The fee is typically a fractional percent (e.g., ½ percent) of the full amount or the unused amount of the line, depending on bank–company negotiations.\n",
    "##### Revolving Credit Agreements\n",
    "a.k.a `revolvers`. \n",
    "\n",
    "They have formal legal agreements that define the aspects of the agreement. These agreements are similar to regular lines with respect to borrowing rates, compensation, and being unsecured. Revolvers differ in that they are in effect for multiple years (e.g., 3–5 years) and may have optional medium-term loan features. In addition, they are often done for much larger amounts than a regular line, and these larger amounts are spread out among more than one bank.\n",
    "#### Money Market Sources\n",
    "- Nonbank finance companies\n",
    "- Commercial paper\n",
    "### Short-Term Borrowing Approaches\n",
    "Passive strategies usually involve minimal activity with one source or type of borrowing and with little (if any) planning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Active strategies are usually more flexible, reflecting planning, reliable forecasting, and seeking the best deal. With active strategies, borrowers are more in control and do not fall into the rollover “trap” that is possible with passive strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many active strategies are matching strategies. Matching borrowing strategies function in a manner similar to matching investment strategies—loans are scheduled to mature when large cash receipts are expected. These receipts can pay back the loan, so the company does not have to invest the funds at potentially lower rates than the borrowing cost, thereby creating unnecessary costs.\n",
    "### Asset-Based Loans\n",
    "Often the assets used in short-term secured loans are the current assets of receivables and inventory. Unlike the collateral that may be used in longer-term borrowing, asset-based loans secured by accounts receivable and inventory present a challenge for the lender because the cash flows from accounts receivable depend on the amount and timing of collections and are influenced by the business risk of the company and its customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides using working capital as the security for a loan, a company can use other means to generate cash flow from these working capital accounts. For example, a company can use its accounts receivable to generate cash flow through the assignment of accounts receivable, which is the use of these receivables as collateral for a loan, or a company can factor its accounts receivable, which is selling the receivables to the factor. In an assignment arrangement, the company remains responsible for the collection of the accounts, whereas in a factoring arrangement the company is shifting the credit granting and collection process to the factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like accounts receivables, inventory may be a source of cash flow through the use of the inventory as collateral, with different types of arrangements possible:\n",
    "1. An inventory blanket lien, in which the lender has a claim on some or all of the company’s inventory, but the company can sell the inventory in the ordinary course of business.\n",
    "2. A trust receipt arrangement, in which the lender requires the company to certify that the goods are segregated and held in trust, with proceeds of any sale remitted to the lender immediately.\n",
    "3. A warehouse receipt arrangement is similar to the trust receipt arrangement, but there is a third party (i.e., a warehouse company) that supervises the inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing the Costs of Borrowing\n",
    "The fundamental rule is to compute the total cost of the form of borrowing and divide that number by the total amount of loan you received (i.e., net proceeds), adjusted for any discounting or compensating balances.\n",
    "#### Commitment Fee\n",
    "In the case of a line of credit that requires a commitment fee, the cost of the line of credit is\n",
    "$$Cost=\\frac{Interest+Commitment\\ fee}{Loan\\ amount}$$\n",
    "#### All-Inclusive Interest Rate\n",
    "On the other hand, if the interest rate is stated as “all inclusive” such that the amount borrowed includes the interest, as may be the case in a banker’s acceptance, the interest is compared with the net proceeds when determining the cost:\n",
    "$$Cost=\\frac{Interest}{Net\\ proceeds}=\\frac{Interest}{Loan\\ amount−Interest}$$\n",
    "#### Fees\n",
    "If there are dealer’s fees and other fees, the expenses beyond the interest must be considered when determining the cost. For example, if a borrowing involves a dealer’s fee and a backup fee and is quoted as all inclusive, the cost is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Cost=\\frac{Interest+Dealer's\\ commission+Backup\\ costs}{Loan\\ amount−Interest}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to compare the interest and fees paid with the net proceeds of the loan. If the loan is for a period less than a year, then we annualize accordingly."
