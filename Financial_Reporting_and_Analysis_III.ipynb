    "  - cost of sales reflects the cost of goods in beginning inventory plus the cost of items purchased (or manufactured) earliest in the accounting period,\n",

In periods of rising prices, the costs assigned to the units in ending inventory are lower than the costs assigned to the units sold. \n",

    "### Calculation of Cost of Sales, Gross Profit, and Ending Inventory\n",
    "In periods of changing prices, the allocation of total inventory costs (i.e., cost of goods available for sale) between cost of sales on the income statement and inventory on the balance sheet will vary depending on the inventory valuation method used by the company.\n",
    "### Periodic Versus Perpetual Inventory Systems\n",
    "Under either system, the allocation of goods available for sale to cost of sales and ending inventory is the same if the inventory valuation method used is either specific identification or FIFO.<br>\n",
    "Under a periodic inventory system, the amount of cost of goods available for sale allocated to cost of sales and ending inventory may be quite different using the FIFO method compared to the weighted average cost method. Under a perpetual inventory system, inventory values and cost of sales are continuously updated to reflect purchases and sales. As a result, the amount of cost of goods available for sale allocated to cost of sales and ending inventory is similar under the FIFO and weighted average cost methods. Because of lack of disclosure and the dominance of perpetual inventory systems, analysts typically do not make adjustments when comparing a company using the weighted average cost method with a company using the FIFO method.<br>\n",
    "When inventory costs are increasing and inventory unit levels are stable or increasing, using the LIFO method will result in higher cost of sales and lower inventory carrying amounts than using the FIFO method. The higher cost of sales under LIFO will result in lower gross profit, operating income, income before taxes, and net income. Income tax expense will be lower under LIFO, causing the company’s net operating cash flow to be higher. On the balance sheet, the lower inventory carrying amount will result in lower reported current assets, working capital, and total assets. Analysts must carefully assess the financial statement implications of the choice of inventory valuation method when comparing companies that use the LIFO method with companies that use the FIFO method.\n",
    "#### Periodic System\n",
    "Inventory values and costs of sales are determined at the end of an accounting period. <br>\n",
    "Purchases are recorded in a purchases account. The total of purchases and beginning inventory is the amount of goods available for sale during the period. The ending inventory amount is subtracted from the goods available for sale to arrive at the cost of sales. The quantity of goods in ending inventory is usually obtained or verified through a physical count of the units in inventory. \n",

    "### Comparison of Inventory Valuation Methods\n",

Accordingly, because cost of sales will be higher under FIFO, a company’s gross profit, operating profit, and income before taxes will be lower.\n",

    "- Balance sheet:\n",
    "  - lower ending inventory, working capital, total assets, retained earnings, and shareholders’ equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lower income tax paid will result in higher net cash flow from operating activities. Some of the financial ratio effects are a lower current ratio, higher debt-to-equity ratios, and lower profitability ratios.\n",
    "### LIFO Reserve\n",
    "It is the FIFO inventory value less the LIFO inventory value.<br>\n",
    "#### Inventory Carrying Amount\n",
    "To compare companies using LIFO with companies not using LIFO, inventory is adjusted by adding the disclosed LIFO reserve to the inventory balance that is reported on the balance sheet. \n",
    "#### Cost of Sales\n",
    "Cost of sales is adjusted by subtracting the increase in the LIFO reserve during the period from the cost of sales amount that is reported on the income statement. If the LIFO reserve has declined during the period, the decrease in the reserve is added to the cost of sales amount that is reported on the income statement. \n",
    "### LIFO Liquidations\n",
    "When the number of units sold exceeds the number of units purchased or manufactured, the number of units in ending inventory is lower than the number of units in beginning inventory and a company using LIFO will experience a LIFO liquidation (some of the older units held in inventory are assumed to have been sold). \n",
    "\n",
    "If inventory unit costs have been rising from period to period and LIFO liquidation occurs, this will produce an inventory-related increase in gross profits. The increase in gross profits occurs because of the lower inventory carrying amounts of the liquidated units. The lower inventory carrying amounts are used for cost of sales and the sales are at the current prices. The gross profit on these units is higher than the gross profit that would be recognised using more current costs. These inventory profits caused by a LIFO liquidation, however, are one-time events and are not sustainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysts should be aware that management can potentially manipulate and inflate their company’s reported gross profits and net income at critical times by intentionally reducing inventory quantities and liquidating older layers of LIFO inventory (selling some units of beginning inventory). During economic downturns, LIFO liquidation may result in higher gross profit than would otherwise be realised. If LIFO layers of inventory are temporarily depleted and not replaced by fiscal year-end, LIFO liquidation will occur resulting in unsustainable higher gross profits. Therefore, it is imperative to review the LIFO reserve footnote disclosures to determine if LIFO liquidation has occurred. **A decline in the LIFO reserve from the prior period may be indicative of LIFO liquidation.**\n",
    "### Inventory Method Changes\n",
    "Under IFRS, if the change is justifiable, then it is applied retrospectively. Under US GAAP, if a company decides to change to the LIFO method, it must do so on a prospective basis and retrospective adjustments are not made to the financial statements. The carrying amount of inventory under the old method becomes the initial LIFO layer in the year of LIFO adoption."

    "## Inventory Adjustments\n",
    "#### Under IFRS\n",
    "IFRS state that inventories shall be measured (and carried on the balance sheet) at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In the event that the value of inventory declines below the carrying amount on the balance sheet, the inventory carrying amount must be written down to its net realisable value14 and the loss (reduction in value) recognised as an expense on the income statement. This expense may be included as part of cost of sales or reported separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each subsequent period, a new assessment of net realisable value is made. Reversal (limited to the amount of the original write-down) is required for a subsequent increase in value of inventory previously written down. The reversal of any write-down of inventories is recognised as a reduction in cost of sales (reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as an expense).\n",
    "#### Under US GAAP\n",
    "Inventories measured using other than LIFO and retail inventory methods are measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value. This is broadly consistent with IFRS with one major difference: **US GAAP prohibit the reversal of write-downs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For inventories measured using LIFO (and retail inventory methods), market value is defined as current replacement cost subject to upper and lower limits. Market value cannot exceed net realisable value (selling price less reasonably estimated costs of completion and disposal). The lower limit of market value is net realisable value less a normal profit margin. Any write-down to market value or net realisable value reduces the value of the inventory, and the loss in value (expense) is generally reflected in the income statement in cost of goods sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "IAS 2 [Inventories] does not apply to the inventories of producers of agricultural and forest products and minerals and mineral products, nor to commodity broker–traders. These inventories may be measured at net realisable value (fair value less costs to sell and complete). Changes in the value of inventory (increase or decrease) are recognised in profit or loss in the period of the change. US GAAP is similar to IFRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mark-to-market inventory accounting is allowed for bullion.\n",
    "#### Impact on Some Financial Ratios\n",
    "An inventory write-down reduces both profit and the carrying amount of inventory on the balance sheet and thus has a negative effect on profitability, liquidity, and solvency ratios. However, activity ratios (for example, inventory turnover and total asset turnover) will be positively affected by a write-down because the asset base (denominator) is reduced. The negative impact on some key ratios, due to the decrease in profit, may result in the reluctance by some companies to record inventory write-downs unless there is strong evidence that the decline in the value of inventory is permanent. This is especially true under US GAAP where reversal of a write-down is prohibited.\n",

    "- the total carrying amount of inventories and the carrying amount in classifications (for example, merchandise, raw materials, production supplies, work in progress, and finished goods) appropriate to the entity;\n",
    "- the carrying amount of inventories carried at fair value less costs to sell;\n",

    "These could lead to temporary differences in the consolidated versus the parent’s financial statements. The deferred tax liability will be recognized unless both the parent controls the timing of the reversal and the temporary difference will probably not reverse. A deferred tax asset will only be recognized if the temporary differences will reverse in the future and taxable profits exist to use the temporary difference."
